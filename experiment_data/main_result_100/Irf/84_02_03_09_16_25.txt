Yes
The person's answers to the questions of the mental scale indicate a sense of isolation, feeling like a burden, and feeling like an outsider in social gatherings. These responses suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a key factor in depression and other mental health problems.

Correct
Continue to carefully assess the specific answers on the mental health scale and accurately connect them to the conceptual elements of mental health concerns, such as thwarted belongingness. Ensure that your interpretation is always backed up by the evidence provided and maintain this structured and critical approach to analysing self-reported data.
