Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So I'm supposed to graduate in December and I don't think it's going to happen. I have let myself slip because of health problems and no matter how much I study, I can't get past a B or C on exams. Even got a 23% on a test I took last week. I feel so stupid and lost, why did I do this to myself? I can't even talk to my professors because I always get the same response,  if I help you, I have to help others.  What's the point? The only reason I won't take my life is because I don't want to leave my mom with my student loans but I just wish I could end it all. Be on an island by myself and drift away from it all
