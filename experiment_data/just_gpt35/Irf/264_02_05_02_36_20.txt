Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I just spent new years eve alone on a rooftop. I really didn't want to celebrate this night with other people so I ignored every invitation and ran off before any neighbors could inivite me... But I still want wish everyone of you a good year. Nobody bothered to call or message me but I still have this sub. Things may not be any better just because another 24 hours passed, but to everyone who also spends the night alone: I wish you a great year and good luck for the things you're going to attempt!
