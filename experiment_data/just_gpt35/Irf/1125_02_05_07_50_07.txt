Post:
  Hey guys, I'm a 22 year old male from Australia. I'm very new to reddit and I thought that this is one of the most important message boards. I've had depression since I was approximately 15 after I lost a friend to suicide. My psychologist also believes I have borderline personality disorder. The whole point of this post is to say thank you for existing, you are not alone.

The poster mentions experiencing depression and losing a friend to suicide, which can contribute to feelings of being a burden on others. Additionally, mentioning the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder suggests that the individual may struggle with interpersonal relationships and have difficulty managing emotions, which can further contribute to a sense of perceived burdensomeness.
