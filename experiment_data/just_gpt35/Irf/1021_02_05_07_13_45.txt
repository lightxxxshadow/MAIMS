True Label:	No
Post:
  There are things I'd like to do sure...but this divorce has broken me. I'm tired of crying all day at work. I'm tired if not wanting to get out of bed. I'd like to try...but I'm not sure I'm capable. My motivation is completely gone. He stole every dream I had and told me to keep walking. Heartless. And I feel heartless now too. Empty. And I just want to stop feeling it.
