Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm frustrated with my life. I have very few friends, and as a 20 year old college student about to turn 21 it‚Äôs driving me crazy to realize that I can‚Äôt celebrate it with anyone. My closest friends are all younger than me, and 2 of the closest are 16 (don‚Äôt worry, I met them through my job, I‚Äôm not a pedophile), so I feel pathetic for being unable to make friends my own age. It‚Äôs just plain creepy. Only thing that keeps people from calling me out is that I look only a year older than them. I‚Äôm gay, in a hyper conservative family, so I can‚Äôt please anyone in it. I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I‚Äôm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I‚Äôm gay, I‚Äôm a pedophile. The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting. I try approaching the LGBT groups on campus but I feel like they‚Äôll ostracize me for other reasons. I feel like I was cheated my teenage years by my restrictive parents, now I‚Äôm lonely and angry at everyone around me for having what I couldn‚Äôt. My siblings are successful, and I feel like the dissappointment and failure of the family. I have much more anger but these are the ones that keep popping up today, and I just wanted to vent about it somewhere.
