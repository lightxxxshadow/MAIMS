Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Im afraid. The suicide scale is true. Its gets progressively worse and you dont even realize it. I was at 1 contemplating death and that was it. Now as i live i keep moving farther into the scale. Not existing is all i long for. Its all i think about. Its all i desire. Ive written 2 goodbye notes. I constantly open up the lid of pills and acting as if ill swallow them. Yesterday and today i have been making nooses with a thin belt and putting it around my neck. I squeeze so hard to simulate what its like. When i do i can feel the pressure in the top sides of my head. I can feel the rush and fear. I stopped giving a shit about everything and my attention is mainly death. Someone please comfort me. I am afraid.
