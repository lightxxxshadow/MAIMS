Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog. It gives me this fuzzy feeling I used to feel with my SO. I know it‚Äôs terrible for me. I still work out but that only gives me an hour high. I‚Äôve realized if I‚Äôm sober my thoughts consume me and when I‚Äôm drunk everything‚Äôs ok. My family and friends wonder how I do it but I guess I like the depressing hungover feeling.

The poster expresses a preference for feeling hungover and states that their thoughts consume them when sober. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as they may perceive their thoughts and emotions as overwhelming and burdensome without the numbing effects of alcohol.
