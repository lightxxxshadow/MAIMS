Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've been dealing with this for about 4 years now and for no rhyme nor reason, it's back. I've been spending the last couple of days crying non-stop for no reason and it's just utterly embarrassing when I visited the doctor. It's been hard trying to focus for the past few days at work and I feel like I'm not productive at all. Been putting off getting the antidepressants because I didn't want to be reliant on them but I think it's time to give them a shot.
