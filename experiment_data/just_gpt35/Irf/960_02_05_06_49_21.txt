Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've thought about talking to someone but I can't get past the feeling that they will start to worry way too much and I don't want to be a nuisance. If I talk to either my mother or my brother they will probably force me to go back home or try to change my lifestyle somehow. Am I overthinking this? Probably. Has anyone talked about this to someone? How did it go? What measures did they take to help you? I feel like hearing some other experience about this might make it easier to do myself...

The post suggests a fear of burdening others with their problems and a hesitation to seek help due to potential negative consequences. This may indicate a feeling of alienation or a lack of belongingness, which can be a risk factor for mental health issues.
