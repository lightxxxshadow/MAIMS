Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Can‚Äôt make anyone happy anymore, what‚Äôs the point? None of my friends care despite me reaching out and my fianc√©e is fed up with my depressive shit. Don‚Äôt even think he wants to marry me any more. I can tell he resents me. I can‚Äôt fix the things that are wrong with me. Why bother with anything? Don‚Äôt wanna upset my family so I‚Äôll just keep trecking on I guess. Just needed to vent cause I don‚Äôt have any real people to talk to.

Yes
The post indicates feelings of being a burden on others, as the poster mentions that they can't make anyone happy anymore, their friends don't care despite reaching out, and their fiancé is fed up with their depressive state. They also express the belief that their fiancé doesn't want to marry them anymore and feels resentful towards the poster. These thoughts and perceptions suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
Ensure to base your inferences on specific statements made in the post to accurately reflect the feelings of the poster without overgeneralizing. Continue to differentiate between what is explicitly stated and what might be implied, focusing on the feelings and perceptions of the poster themselves, not the people around them.
