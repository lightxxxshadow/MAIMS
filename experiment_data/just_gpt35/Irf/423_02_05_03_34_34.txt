Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  There is utter absence of meaning in my day to day life. I would love nothing more than to feel or do anything other than artificial emotions and automated actions, but alas must take that pill or else it will all crumble, oh and that pill, and maybe these 3 too. It‚Äôs a fine line between authentic peace and self destruction that I‚Äôve been on for what feels like a life time, but unfortunately it‚Äôs only been a year and that life time is all I have to look forward to.
