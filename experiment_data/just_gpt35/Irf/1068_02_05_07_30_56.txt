Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I used to be super emotional and negative but now I'm less emotional and more apathetic and sometimes it feels like I'm just there. Like just living and breathing. Like it feels almost spacey. I'm also super lazy and procrastinate hardcore. idk if it's possible for me to still have depression especially since I don't get severe sadness anymore and rarely cry. I'm I just something else?
