Post:
  Things have been super hard for me lately. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about death and suicide, more than I ever have. I‚Äôve been having detailed thoughts of suicide‚Äîhow I would do it, where I would do it, what time of day I would do it, how people would react, IF people would react... for the first time in my life I feel like I might actually do it one of these days but idk.
