Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel this might be one of the worst parts for me. I tell people no to hanging out constantly because I can't get out of bed, I work as much overtime as possible to avoid real interaction and I mask it with determination but as soon as friends do something without inviting me I'm heartbroken. I've always suffered from mild depression but I was alright until about 5 years ago bulimia snuck in. Right before my eyes it creeped into a crippling depression, but I can't even place when it got this bad. I get happy for moments and my mind quickly tells me it won't last and puts me back in my place I don't feel like anyone close to me fully understands. Yesterday I went to a party with close friends and hardly spoke to anyone. To make matters worse, a guy I used to talk to that was flirting with a good friend of mine and now I'm anxious that they think that's why I was upset when really my depression just felt like it was a good time to kick in. Which brings me to my severe social anxiety.......long spiraling story short I've only gotten out of bed once today to make a sandwich, ate said sandwich in bed and went back to sleep. I'm sorry this is not well spoken, it's probably not much of a read I just needed to get this out somewhere.

The poster mentions feeling like a burden to others, specifically mentioning how they constantly say no to hanging out, avoid real interaction, and work overtime to avoid social situations. This indicates a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.
