Post:
  I always wear my earphones when I first wake up, when I eat my breakfast, and before going to bed. basically all of the time. I think my music is my escape from all of this bullshit in life. Btw I listen to bands like: Thy Art Is Murder, Suicide Silence, Make Them Suffer, The Amity Affliction, and Infant Annihilator.
