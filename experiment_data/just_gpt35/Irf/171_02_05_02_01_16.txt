Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  All these people lying to me and going behind my back every day has made me bitter and cold. I really miss the feeling of meeting someone new and being interested but I just assume the worst in people and can‚Äôt seem to be happy in a relationship. Anyone else agree!??
