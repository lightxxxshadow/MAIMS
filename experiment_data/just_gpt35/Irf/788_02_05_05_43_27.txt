Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I've had about three interviews and a couple phone interviews and nothing yet. I know it's the holidays and no one is hiring en masse yet. But, God, sitting around the house sucks. I miss just buying things without having to do quick mental math to see if I could afford it. I intend on joining the plumbers union, but God help me if I don't get in.
