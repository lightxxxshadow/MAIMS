Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm pretending to feel positive emotions, and it makes me terrified. It scares me to know that I am not truly reacting to anything, but just putting on a mask to please others. It just makes me feel worse than I already do. I don't know what to do.
