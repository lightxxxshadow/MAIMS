True Label:	No
Post:
  [I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences] I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety. For the first week I was prescribed 5mg, 10mg thereafter. It's been two days and I have this mild feeling like I'm on ecstasy/MDMA. My body feels light and I have this weird concentration of energy above my neck at the back of my head. Has anyone felt this/experienced this?
