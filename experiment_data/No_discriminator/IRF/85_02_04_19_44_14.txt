Yes
The poster's answers to the questions of the mental scale indicate a high level of perceived burdensomeness. They strongly believe that they are a burden on society, that their death would be a relief to others, and that they make things worse for the people in their life. This suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is commonly associated with depression and other mental health issues.
