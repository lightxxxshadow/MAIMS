Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm fake , the person everyone knows is actually just an act . I‚Äôm that guy all of you know but don‚Äôt really know . I‚Äôm that guy that makes the whole room laugh . I‚Äôm that guy that is always there to help someone . I‚Äôm that guy that no matter how much pain it‚Äôs caused me I will forgive someone. But the truth is nobody knows who I really am , I don‚Äôt even know who I really am . I spend so much time being the fake me that I have lost me . But do any of us really know who we are ? I just want to be free . Behind my smile is pain and hatred , every laugh is a distraction. Like every good show it has a beginning and an end and I don‚Äôt know when it began or how it will end . Like everyone else I‚Äôm just an audience member watching .
