Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hello. I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much. I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand. To summarize for you all: * They were involved in some deep stuff. * Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head. * The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. &gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed. * They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment. * Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly. I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them. What can I do?

Yes
The post indicates that the person is experiencing feelings of social disconnection, lack of support from others, and loneliness. They mention that their friends have turned their back on them, they are distant from their only remaining friend, and feel that they rarely interact with people who care about them. These feelings align with the concept of thwarted belongingness, which refers to a sense of not belonging or not being connected to others, and can contribute to mental health difficulties.
