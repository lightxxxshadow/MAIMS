Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've realized I was fucked from the day I was born.My mother from another country is disabled &amp; lived off SSI her whole life.My father,a paranoid schizophrenic who punished me for not  loving Jehovah enough  has never worked a day in his life.Family of five lived off the income of one (two SSI incomes count as one). My brothers becoming violent &amp; angry over having no future.Myself being anxious,depressed,possible Aspergers,hearing loss &amp; tinnitus has guaranteed my life is fucked. I wrote several suicide notes,just as a practice back in December when I turned 30.Yeah,I'm one of those aspiring actor types that refuses to work at Wal-Mart because they hate unions &amp; a living wage. No decent rich actor will ever want me.I would prefer to have a partner working in an area I have shared interests in like film.I live off of donations because my area has a lot of homeless shelters plus I get financial aid. Maybe I can make up the man of my dreams in my imagination.Its the closest I'll ever get to someone like Michael Fassbender,Taron Egerton or Dan Stevens.Every day I wake up &amp; ask why.......just why?Often I hope not to wake up at all.The only peace I have is in sleep.Sadly beeause of insomnia I cant even have peace.

The post indicates a strong sense of social isolation and lack of belonging. The poster expresses feelings of being disconnected from their family, society, and potential partners. They mention being anxious, depressed, and having possible Aspergers, which can further contribute to difficulties in forming meaningful connections with others. The mention of contemplating suicide and relying on donations and financial aid suggest a lack of social support and fulfillment in personal relationships.
