Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I haven't been diagnosed with depression and I can't bring up the courage to tell anyone how I'm feeling, but I researched and I have all symptoms. I have constant suicidal thoughts and I have a sh problem. And everyday, I keep feeling worse. I feel utterly worthless and stupid and I don't know why. And it's really hard to type this post because I've never opened up this much to anybody. I have felt this way for a long time (like, a few years) and I really want to know what's wrong with me. I almost never enjoy my life anymore and I want to give up but I'm scared of hurting family members. I always act so happy and cheerful around them and I don't want them to find out the truth. Can someone give me an answer?

The post mentions feeling worthless, having constant suicidal thoughts, and not wanting to burden family members by revealing the truth. These feelings of isolation and fear of rejection suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a common factor in depression and suicidal ideation.
