Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hi everyone I'm new to this sub but I just need some help with my change. For two years I have been actively self harming whether it was cutting or doing other bad stuff. I had friends that tried to help but I could never get myself to stop. Recently I found myself in a really positive relationship and because I love my boyfriend, I agreed to give him my blades and he promised he would keep them out of reach. I did this because I feel okay knowing they still exist even if I can't get to them. I could never get myself to throw them away. But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury. For anyone who has successfully quit cutting, how did you do it? Because right now, two weeks in, I only feel so much worse.

The post indicates that the individual has been engaging in self-harming behaviors for two years and has recently given up their blades as a result of being in a positive relationship. However, they are now feeling depressed and express a need for a way to release or cope with their emotions. This suggests a possible risk of thwarted belongingness, as the removal of self-injury as a coping mechanism has left them feeling worse and potentially disconnected from others.
