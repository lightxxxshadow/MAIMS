Post:
  It's a pleasure to meet everyone in this subreddit, even though the context of it isn't really pleasant in a sense... You can call me Matthew, I had decided to create a account in order to express myself about my life and the struggles that come against me everyday, I hope those messages can come to be of some use to somebody. Upon typing this I realised, my English is still too bad.
