Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Most of the time it‚Äôs the opposite, but sometimes, when I get really depressed, I want to have sex or pleasure myself as much as I possibly can. I just feel worse afterwards, but I always do it. Don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs like that sometimes. Perplexes me. Anyone have a similar experience? Just wanted to share.
