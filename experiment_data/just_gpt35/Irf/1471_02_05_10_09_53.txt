Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  When people say happiness is a choice it makes it seem to me that they‚Äôre saying happiness is being dangled above me and if I jump high enough, if I strengthen my legs enough I‚Äôll be able to jump high enough to reach it. When in actuality, because I suffer from depression, how It feels to me: I‚Äôm trapped in shackles, and I can see happiness behind a glass wall. It‚Äôs illuminating and glowing, and I can see others basking it it‚Äôs glow, prompting me to come join them. Then they start trying to yell encouragement at me like ‚Äúyou can do it!‚Äù ‚ÄúCome get your happiness,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not trying hard enough!‚Äù ‚ÄúTry harder,‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I struggle against my shackles I can‚Äôt reach it, I can‚Äôt get to it. I could struggle until my limbs bleed, and I still wouldn‚Äôt be able to reach it. Because with how my mind is, it‚Äôs an unobtainable dream. Then when others try to suggest it‚Äôs from lack of trying, well it feels like they‚Äôre rubbing salt in the cuts that the shackles have dug into my limbs.

The post suggests a sense of feeling trapped and unable to attain happiness, along with feeling like others are encouraging and pressuring the poster to overcome their struggles. This can indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may feel that they are a burden to others due to their inability to reach happiness despite their efforts.
