Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  In this world full of wifi connection, human connection seems obsolete. I feel so alone. It's a cliche feeling, I know. Me against the world and nobody is on my side. The world is winning, etc. But I just feel so down. So so so depressed. I told myself that this 2018 I will embrace what is real - real people, real words, real friends. And then I realized everyone around me is fake. I envy those people who have friends who stick with them whatever happens. I wonder if I could still find real friends nowadays. Just one real friend would be nice. Just so I don't feel this way anymore. Some will say this too shall pass but it has been weeks and it ain't done yet.
