Yes
The poster's statement of feeling hopeless, having the same cycle every day, lacking interest in life, and questioning the point of living are all indicative of symptoms commonly associated with depression.

Correct
Continue to carefully evaluate posts for explicit expressions of feelings and thoughts that can be indicative of mental health issues, while also considering the importance of not overgeneralizing or inferring beyond the provided information. Remain cautious to not diagnose but rather flag signs that suggest the possibility of depression, encouraging the individual to seek assistance from a mental health professional.
