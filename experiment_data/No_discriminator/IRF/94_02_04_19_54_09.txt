Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I gave up all the weed and alcohol that I was doing last semester, but it was the only thing that helped. I feel like I have no one at all. I ruin everything and every friendship i have. If I don't get on something that takes me away from this dark, dark room that's my head, I cannot last long. This is all too much. Is there anybody out there even reading this? Will anyone care?
