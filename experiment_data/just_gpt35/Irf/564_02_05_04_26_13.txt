The poster mentions feeling better overall and staying away from self-destructive behaviors when they are actively taking care of their mental health. However, they also express a pattern of relapsing back into depression and not knowing how to break the cycle. This indicates a sense of thwarted belongingness, as they struggle to maintain a consistent state of well-being and feel disconnected from a stable source of support or happiness.
