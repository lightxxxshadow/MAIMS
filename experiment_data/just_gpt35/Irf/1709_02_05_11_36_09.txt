Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  *Posting on behalf of friend* Basically I'm perpetually sad, but for no apparent reason (I work a lot at 17, but that seems normal) I think suicide is a valid option, as I would be at peace, but I do not want to commit suicide due to friends and family feeling bad. I also feel lonely, even around friends and family which leads to me think this is depression. Is this depression, or is this just a phase? Thanks for reading.

The post indicates that the person perceives themselves as a burden to their friends and family, as they mention not wanting to commit suicide because it would make their loved ones feel bad. This suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is often associated with suicidal ideation.
