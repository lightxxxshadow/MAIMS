Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  A vent more than advice post my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave she messages me saying  bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me  half an hour later she messages again saying  bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his.  and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row. not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me. tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks.

No
The poster's feeling of being put on the backburner, not being a priority, and feeling disappointed does not necessarily indicate a diagnosis of depression. These feelings may be a result of situational frustration or disappointment rather than clinical depression.

Correct
Ensure to distinguish between normal emotional responses to specific situations and clinical symptoms of mental health issues. Keep using cautious language when not enough evidence is present to support a diagnosis.
