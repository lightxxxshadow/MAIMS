Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I been thinking about religion. Like if you believe their is a God. Well he or she since God created man and women. Well God is the only super hero. I started to believe in a God since DINOSAURS. Even I try to pray to a God to take me back to 1994. Even my life is going no where. I have a mental illness called schizophrenia where the brain cognitive is dysfunctional. Hallucinations and hearing voices that arent their. Which makes me think solipsism. But hell im no God when I believe a God. Since I didnt create clouds trees or even DINOSAURS. I admit mental illness has no path of success. Even I want to give up to pray for a new one cause im getting old. If I could live forever I would cause dying isnt going to get better. It only gets better to a human that isnt God. Don't you think if their is a God that he or she would remember everything?
