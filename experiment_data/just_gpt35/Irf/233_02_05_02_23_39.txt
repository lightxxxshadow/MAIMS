Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I am M/16 and I suffer from depression. It all started when I was around 12-13 years old when I found out I was gay. I have friends that I can talk to but it just doesnt help me much. In the last weeks my suicidal thoughts have increased by alot and anxiety and an uncomfortable feeling in my chest has increased too. I just want to get comforted by someone (I would prefer my crush lol) I dont want to sound desperate but is here anyone who can try to make me feel better? My emotional pain has grown by alot recently and often times I just want to die but I cant kill myself because I dont want to hurt my close ones. Please help me :( Edit: Idk if anything Im writing makes sense but I just feel so hopeless and I kind of want to fight against it but most of the time I dont feel like I even have enough power to reach out for help and just let myself drown in my despair and pain. Can anyone understand me?

The post indicates a high risk of perceived burdensomeness as the individual expresses feelings of emotional pain, hopelessness, and a desire to die but refrains from doing so to avoid hurting their close ones.
