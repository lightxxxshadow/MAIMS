Yes
The poster expresses feelings of worthlessness, self-hatred, and believing that they are a burden to others. They mention wanting to disappear and feeling the disgust of others even in their deathbed. These statements indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
The student has accurately identified the risk of perceived burdensomeness in the poster's statements, which is consistent with the poster's expressions of self-deprecation, feelings of worthlessness, and beliefs of being a burden to others as reflected in the post and the mental scale responses. Continue to evaluate the provided evidence carefully to support your conclusions, ensuring that each part of your assessment is directly informed by the subject's own words and responses to the mental health scale questions. Avoid making unwarranted assumptions that go beyond the evidence at hand.
