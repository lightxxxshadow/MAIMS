Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  People keep telling me that if I kill myself, then the depression will win the fight. Here‚Äôs the catch, they think I fucking care if it wins. I don‚Äôt give a shit anymore. I‚Äôm not even using a throwaway account because I don‚Äôt care about keeping it a secret. Why would I care if the depression wins? All I want is peace, and if it takes the depression winning over me to achieve that, then why should I care at all? I don‚Äôt. Idk why I‚Äôm even posting here. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm subconsciously looking for help, or just attention. Who knows. I don‚Äôt want to hurt my family, but at the same time I‚Äôm hurting them when I even tell them about my thoughts. I can‚Äôt fucking win anything anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm so goddamn pathetic it‚Äôs unbelievable. Sometimes I wish I was killed by a robber or shooter just so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my family wondering what they did wrong.
