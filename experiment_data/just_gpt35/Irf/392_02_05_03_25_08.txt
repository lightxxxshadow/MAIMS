Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  A friend I've met in Discord is having problems with not only his ADHD, Depression and Anxiety but with his manipulative uncle. He's living with his uncle but he can't really do anything, he yells at him, disconnects him from the internet for weeks for laughing and is one of the reasons he's depressed. I want to know what would be the best way to help him? He has already tried contacting the police but the situation seems to become worse by the week. I don't live near him (and by that i mean within a 500km radius) so I can't help him directly

The post indicates that the individual is experiencing difficulties in their relationships, specifically with their manipulative uncle. This interpersonal conflict and the feeling of being disconnected from others can contribute to a sense of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for mental health problems.
