Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Ive been really depressed lately... My math subject at school failed, i keep thinking i wont graduate, i have no energy to go to school anymore so i fake everything and go to a nearby computer cafe even though i only have enough money to commute to my school. I know lifes hard but theres something in my brain that broke... Im not crazy though just uncaring. But i noticed i suddenly grew an interest on one of our kitchen knives, not like to hurt people, its just an odd interest where you imagine the knife killing you painlessly. But the thing is, i have a phobia of sharp things so i grew up cautious with sharp objects including knives... Its not really bad, i just do stabbing motions on myself, but the point is i consider doing that normal. I also keep daydreaming while walking and oddly enough i daydream about me getting in a car crash or something similar, which i has a high chance of happening considering im daydreaming. Another point is my fake laughter, i dont know why i keep doing it. I know im probably mentally ill but i have no why of knowing since psychiatrists and therapists costs very much in my country. Anyway im just rambling about my problems but i have a feeling itll all end soon. Just a feeling...

The post indicates feelings of isolation and disconnection from others, such as not having energy to go to school and faking everything. The mention of a broken brain and feeling uncaring suggests a lack of social connection. Additionally, the poster mentions an odd interest in a kitchen knife and daydreaming about harmful situations, which may be indicative of a desire to escape or a wish for self-harm. These factors point towards a potential risk of thwarted belongingness.
