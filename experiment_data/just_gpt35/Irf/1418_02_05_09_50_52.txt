  And I really want to help him somehow but I just don't know how. I don't understand how he feels to be honest, since we are just so different I guess, but I try. What should I do? We don't live in the same city, so I'm taking a day off from college and going home this weekend. Is it a good idea to take origami paper to fold origami or play chess or something similar? He doesn't know any of those, so I thought maybe a new activity might help. What do you think?
