Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My truck metaphor of the things that run me over all ay once everyday. It's a long story I could probably write a book... i might write a book... lol I used to struggle HEAVILY with severe anxiety and my parents would belittle it until I was having anxiety attacks and even then they said that therapists were for crazy people (my parents are very traditional and care about what others could say about you). My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down. Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space. And that was new because I've never loved someone like I love him. He is the light of my life and existence no matter how much shit we have been through in the last 3.5y. Yoga and meditation and send awareness got me though that, mostly. Regardles... very very long story continues and I'm not used to things going well so when I have a small problem or inconvenience I react and prepare to be hit by my metaphorical truck.. Also my day could be great and I get home and my family ruins anything and everything. Sorry this is all over the place but so are my emotions.
