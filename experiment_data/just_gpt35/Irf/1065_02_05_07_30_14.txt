Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôve been feeling pretty lost lately, lack of motivation, all my work gets put off until the very last minute then I cram it in. And the mornings are the hardest part, because waking up means I have to deal with all the thoughts running through my head. It‚Äôs come to the point where I have to physically drag myself out of bed now. It gets harder to want to wake up every day.
