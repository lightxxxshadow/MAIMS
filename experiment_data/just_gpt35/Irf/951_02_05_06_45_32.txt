Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I have a sensitive topic to discuss with someone like a therapist. I'm looking for advice, but I left my last therapist because I didn't have time to see her anymore. Is there somewhere online I can go to talk to someone? I need someone I can be completely honest with and the online barrier kinda helps me with that. *Not suicidal, just looking for help*

The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness as the user explicitly mentions that they are not suicidal, and are just looking for help.
