Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  We had a rough day. You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days. But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think. Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. But sometimes it turns into something a little worse. The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful. And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this. We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things. I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal. A bad friend. Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day. Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves. Why people killed themselves. Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue. Maybe it was people like me. Maybe I was a bad person after all. I wish I could've been someone better. So, in that case, I'm sorry.

The post mentions feeling like a bad person and feeling the need to be someone better, which may indicate a sense of not belonging or feeling disconnected from others. There is also a mention of understanding why some people hurt themselves or commit suicide, which suggests a deeper level of psychological distress and a perceived lack of social connectedness.
