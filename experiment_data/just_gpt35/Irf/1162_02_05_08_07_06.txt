Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  It's kind of getting to me. I've never been in a relationship, only been on a date twice, I don't even have that many friends. When my dad was my age he was married and had a kid. I know it's not everything, but I feel like I've done so little and have had such a bad time so far. I've been trying online dating but nobody ever responds to my messages. Sorry if this is a jumble. I needed to vent my thoughts I've been having lately.
