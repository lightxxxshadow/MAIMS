Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm 14 and I just lost my virginity, I felt unbelievable. I was so happy. Morning came along when me and her had sobered up. She says she doesn‚Äôt regret it but now I feel awful and my paranoia is telling me that she hates me and she hates what we did. All I want to do is run a bath and have a nap with my head under the water.

The post suggests that the individual feels burdened by negative thoughts and attitudes about themselves, particularly in relation to their recent sexual experience. This perception of burdensomeness is evidenced by their feelings of paranoia, believing that the other person involved hates them and regrets the encounter. The desire to escape through running a bath and placing their head underwater indicates a potential risk for self-harm or suicidal ideation, further emphasizing the sense of perceived burdensomeness.
