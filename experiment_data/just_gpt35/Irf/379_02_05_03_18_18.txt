Post:
  Why is it so damn hard to find any sense of purpose? I wake up every morning feeling like a disappointing peace of garbage who can't accomplish anything and it's eating away at me. I suck at everything I try to do and I feel like I'm just a disappointment to my family. Maybe tomorrow will be better.
