  :(( not sure wats wrong with me. i think i‚Äôve been feeling ok lately, content. now i‚Äôm having bad thoughts again. i‚Äôm overwhelmed. i feel so alone... no one actually gives a shit about how i feel. it won‚Äôt end :( i think i was meant to commit suicide. i feel stupid for trying to be positive. I got an actual 60% on this assignment at school and it fucked with me. i cried in the bathroom stall and cut myself up like the pathetic idiot i am. i‚Äôm so tired of myself.

The post clearly shows feelings of loneliness, being overwhelmed, and a belief that no one cares about the person's feelings. These are indicative of a risk of thwarted belongingness, which refers to a feeling of not belonging or lacking social connection.
