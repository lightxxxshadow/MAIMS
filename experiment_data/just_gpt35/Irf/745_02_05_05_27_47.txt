Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My job sucks. I know everybody and their mothers complain about working, but my job SUCKS. The bosses are total unprofessional cunts, they are uncouth and rude, they yell at everyone. They want me to do shit that I can't do. I work at a tv repair company. they take broken tv's, they fix em, they sell em. I broke one. They are going to sue me. I reckon i have a good case, because the tv was in a prone position to get damaged. And i know i can win the case. but im still nervous and anxious. I really want to quit. but i need the money. I need advice.

The post primarily focuses on dissatisfaction with the job and the bosses, as well as anxiety about being sued. It does not directly indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which refers to a belief that one is a burden on others. However, the person does express a desire to quit, which could indicate potential stress or burnout related to the job.
