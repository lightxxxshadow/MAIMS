Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  When I was severely depressed, my therapist recommended using distraction to prevent myself from being consumed by flashbacks of former trauma. This was necessary during that time; now my mood is stable (I'm consistently exercising and meditating), but I continue to need to distract myself. I've spent entire days with earbuds and listening to podcasts because of this habit. Does anyone else deal with this? Has anyone broken the habit?
