Post:
  i'm so scared and i'm scared to tell anyone. once i open up they all just run away. it's hard to be awake while i'm in such big pain. i'm so scared i wish i could go back in time. 2018 already fucking sucks but it doesn't really even matter because time is a made up concept and my suffering won't stop :)
