  Ugh. I so don‚Äôt have the energy for this, but 15 people (family and really REALLY close friends of mine- my support network) are coming. Doesn‚Äôt help that I am in the postdrome of a migraine. I just want to hide and cry in my room. T-1hr. 7pm. Then 5hrs of socializing. Ugh. HELP!

The post indicates that the person feels overwhelmed by the upcoming social gathering and expresses a desire to hide and cry. This suggests a possible risk of perceived burdensomeness, as they may perceive themselves as a burden to others and feel exhausted by socializing.
