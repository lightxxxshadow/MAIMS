Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've had a rough two weeks and can't study for shit right now. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone and thoughts of suicide are having a hayday. Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing. My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off. My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.
