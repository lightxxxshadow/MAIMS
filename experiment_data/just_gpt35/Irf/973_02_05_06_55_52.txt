Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I turn twenty-two soon and things are falling apart. I know I have it better than a lot of people‚Äî I have so much to be grateful for. I try to remember those things and keep them front and center. It‚Äôs a big year for me and there are so many due dates, deadlines and things to do‚Äî But I can hardly bring myself to get out of bed. I just don‚Äôt know what the point is, what the end goal is. I feel the only things really keeping me here is my sweet little cat and my mother. I just can‚Äôt shake this strange feeling that I am an outsider in everything I do and everywhere I go. I am tired of it and I just want it to stop. I feel guilty for existing. It‚Äôs like imposter syndrome but for being a person. I feel as though I don‚Äôt have the abilities needed to make my dreams come true, to be genuinely loved by someone, to be resilient enough to withstand the heartache I feel now and the heartache that is inevitably to come. I feel too old to still be self harming and feeling like a ghost. I feel like I don‚Äôt exist already, but somehow I‚Äôm still here. The existential dread is also unbearable and I don‚Äôt know how to lift this crushing weight in my chest. I just want to disappear completely.
