  This is not a fresh memory but it still hurts me the most. 2 months after I got dumped by my ex I had a mental breakdown and locked myself up in the bathroom for hours. I did something stupid and called my ex her friend picks up the phone and tells me to fuck off because I'm bothering them. I tell her that I really need to speak to my ex. They were at a bday party and after she hung up I got like 20 different messages from her friends who were at the party bullying me. Saying that I'm a faggot, need to man up, crybaby faking depression, that they are a better couple etc etc. Made me realise that people are evil.
