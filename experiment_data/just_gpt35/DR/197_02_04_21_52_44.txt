Post:
  I wish my mother understands depression I go to school and work, and right now that's handful for me. I work on weekend as well and I get very exhausted. Today was one of those few days I get that I don't have any class or shift. I got carried away and stayed in bed until 2pm. My mom suddently came home from work (while still at her work, don't know why she even tries to sneek out) pretty much came home to yell at me to get up and clean my room. I always think she forget that I do have depression with medication and have attempted several suicide method. I'm working as hard as I could but she still thinks it's not enough. She's one of those  the harder it hits the better it gets  person. She wouldn't understand that hitting hard could break things. Oh yeah, she also kicked my head to wake me up. That's a thing.
