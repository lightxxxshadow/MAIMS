Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  (48M) I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for probably \~35 years now. I've been on pretty much all the different meds, had 2 rounds of TMS (30 sessions each), and have had therapy. Nothing has made me feel any better. I don't remember any other way to feel but sad, hopeless and suicidal. I don't know how much longer I can keep going on.

Yes
The response to the questions related to belongingness indicates a strong sense of disconnection and feeling like an outsider in social gatherings. The individual also feels like a burden on society and that the people in their life would be better off without them. These feelings suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, where the individual perceives a lack of support and social connection, which can contribute to their depression and suicidal thoughts.

Correct
Continue to analyze the scale responses carefully in the context of the post to avoid overgeneralization. Ensure to differentiate between the poster's own perceptions and objective information.
