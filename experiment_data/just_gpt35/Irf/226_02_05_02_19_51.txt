Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Keeping up the facade at work is cutting too deep these days. I feel a great deal of stress with my work and having this heaped on top certainly doesn't help. I can't sleep, I can't eat right... I'm just so tired of my shitty life and my bitterness at being so alone while the few friends I have are all happy in their relationships. I'm constantly the 3rd or 5th wheel. I know I'm a forever alone and nothing can ever change my situation but it's still just so painful, but at work I have to put on a fake smile and pretend there's nothing wrong.

The post indicates a feeling of loneliness and bitterness about being alone, while friends are in relationships. This sense of isolation can be a sign of thwarted belongingness, where the individual feels excluded and disconnected from social connections.
