True Label:	No
Post:
  My mom caught me with someone, I lied and now she is mad... tl;dr: Mom caught me with someone and also caught me in a big lie. My mom (F54) caught me in a huge lie as well after that, because I was trying to get her out of the house, things have been complicated since I've been lying. Today she arrived sooner than expected and well what i was trying to avoid happened. She is telling me I'm like a 14 year old and doesn't understand why i've done this. That I don't do shit despite me doing house stuff, and working. That  I was your age too  conversation happened. I'm 22 years old and I'm thinking about moving out and doing my own thing, but I feel like I don't need to update people every 10 minutes, is that just me? I don't think I have been lying to her, I just didn't told her I was seeing someone, and to be honest what was she expecting me to say?? To be honest I don't know what to do, can you guys help me dealing with this?? I kinda feel worthless at this point too because of all the things she said to me
