The post mentions overwhelming anxiety as the main issue, not specifically depression.

Be cautious not to overlook comorbidity. Anxiety can coexist with depression, and the phrase 'Life shouldn’t be this miserable' could suggest depressive symptoms. Assess all information for a comprehensive analysis, including mood, thought patterns, and expressed emotions.

Yes
The phrase 'Life shouldn’t be this miserable' suggests depressive symptoms and the overwhelming anxiety could potentially coexist with depression.

Incorrect
Avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information. The post mentions 'overwhelming anxiety' which is not sufficient to diagnose depression. Look for symptoms specific to depression such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, and changes in sleep or appetite before concluding that the poster suffers from depression. Anxiety and depression can co-occur but are not the same condition. Seek more information to make an accurate assessment.
