Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've lost everything. I fucked up my entire life and it's all my doing. Terrible people like me should not stay alive. I lost my relationship with a wondeful person who I treated terribly, my home, my family, my friends, my job, my car, EVERYTHING. Everything I owned was in my car and it got towed while I was living in that car just trying to get back on my feet. And I can't afford to get my car back. Now I'm on the streets and I have no one. Not even my family wants to help anymore. And who can blame them? I have been nothing but a complete disappointment to everyone who has ever had love for and showed me kindness. I have hurt and betrayed everyone in my life. I even did an analysis of my life last night and I realized that I have NEVER succeeded in ANYTHING. I have failed at absolutely everything in my life. I couldn't even finish high school. I'm a complete and total failure. Only thing that has kept me from ending it all is that I'm only 22, so I feel like maybe things could get better until I remembered that I'm most likely going to fucking JAIL because I couldn't take the classes that court appointed me to take. My life is so fucked. I'm so close to just hanging myself or jumping in front of a fucking train.
