Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hi, First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing? I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave &amp;#x200B; has anyone had this ? can anyone help? sorry just a brain dump cheers
