Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Bf just told me he feels no connection anymore and that he doesn't think he will ever love me the same again. It doesn't matter how hard I try everything will always end up turning to shit. I just want to crawl in a hole and never come out. He will never understand how much he hurts me with his words. I wish i could feel the sun light hit my face and smile but instead i only want to cry. Im heading for a dark place in my mind tonight.
