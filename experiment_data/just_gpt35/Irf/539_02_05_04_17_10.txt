Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel as if depression has turned me into some sort of subhuman creature. Every time I talk to one of my friends, they tell me about their days stuffed full of classes and going out and traveling and somehow still fitting in basic care of themselves and their homes. They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species. It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself. I can't fathom having the energy to work, go to school, take care of myself, dedicate time to friends, hygiene, cooking, cleaning, planning, and more all in one day, every day. But everyone I know around me my age seems to be managing such a busy, full life. I feel like a devolved form of them, only having the mental and physical capacity to handle a small fraction of what others continually accomplish daily. Just wondering if anyone else feels no longer human as well.

The post indicates feelings of inadequacy and comparison to others who seem to be handling multiple responsibilities effortlessly. This suggests a perceived burden of not being able to meet the same expectations and feeling like a devolved form of others.
