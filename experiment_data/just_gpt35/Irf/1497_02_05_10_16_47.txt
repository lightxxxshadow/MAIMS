True Label:	No
Post:
  Depression is so exhausting. I used to look forward to going to sleep at night because that was my escape, finally a break. Now it's a time machine to anther rough day. I'm not trying to be a fucking poet, I just needed to put my thoughts somewhere. I'm just tired. I wish I knew what there was to do to make me feel okay again and how to get the energy to do it.
