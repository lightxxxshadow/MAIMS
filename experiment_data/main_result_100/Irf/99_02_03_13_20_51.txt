Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hi, do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear. In my case it can be opening various mail or even starting to read some book. It could even be when I decide to rent a movie. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid and I do not see rational reasons for it, but I get waves of fear that feel like there is a predator that is going to attack. I feel it and I am gripped with stillness and fear as if I am hiding and can‚Äôt move or breathe heavily because it could reveal my position. Because of this I end up not doing things I have to do, missing some deadlines, not going to the dentist. Well the dentist is understandable since no one wants to go to them. In my case it is mundane things. This is probably a symptom of PTSD I am diagnosed with, but I still need to find ways to overcome these irrational fears.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates a fear of being a burden or causing harm to others, as the author mentions feeling gripped with fear and hiding from a perceived predator. These feelings may be consistent with a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is often associated with mental health conditions such as PTSD.

Incorrect
Review the post and the answered questions from the mental health scale without adding interpretations not supported by the evidence. The post shows the individual struggling with fear and possibly PTSD, but there is no mention or evidence of feeling like a burden. Stick strictly to the provided information without making inferences beyond it.

ITER 1
No
No evidence or mention of feeling like a burden in the post or the answered questions from the mental health scale

Correct
Keep focusing on the information presented, and avoid making assumptions that are not supported by the evidence. Continue to differentiate between the subject's emotions and the possibility of perceived burdensomeness, which are distinct concepts. Your analysis should remain grounded in the explicit content of the posts and responses.
