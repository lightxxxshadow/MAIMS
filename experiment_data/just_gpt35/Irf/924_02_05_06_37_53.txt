Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  It was like a big fucking slap to the face. A reminder of how fucking depressed and hopeless I am compared to the rest of my family members. Had to go outside and walk for a bit because I didn't want anyone to see me break down. Idk if I'll still be here for 2019 New Year's Eve, but if I am, I really hope things will be different. If you guys also had a shitty New Year's Eve, I'm really sorry because I know how much it fucking sucks. Hope things get better for you this year. *sending virtual panda hugs*
