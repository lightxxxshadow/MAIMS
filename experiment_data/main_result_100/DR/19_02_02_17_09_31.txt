Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I starve myself When I get depressed, I just can not eat. Everything sounds so gross and eating just seems difficult. I’m a very small person, 5’4 and 100 pounds. It’s something I’m self conscious about but weight gain has always been a struggle for me. I’ll go through periods where I’m doing well and eat 3x a day and manage to put on a few pounds, but then something happens and I slip back into my old ways and the weight falls right back off. Does anyone else do this?

Yes
The poster's answers on the mental scale indicate symptoms of depression, such as sadness, pessimism, feelings of failure, loss of pleasure, self-dislike, loss of interest, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue.

Correct
Ensure to maintain an objective view and avoid over-interpreting the data with unwarranted assumptions about personality or unmentioned issues. It is important to base your assessments strictly on the information provided within the post and responses to the mental health scale, just as you have done correctly here. Continue to distinguish between the poster and others when analyzing mental health situations and remain cautious not to attribute others' conditions to the individual you are assessing.
