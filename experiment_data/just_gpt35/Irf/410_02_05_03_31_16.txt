True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I thought everything was fine, we even had plans to hang out that day, she said she loved me, I said I loved her. Then that night she told me she couldn't be in a relationship with me. She left me in the dust with nothing. She was my best friends but also my only friend in my state since I moved. I have no one now and I feel like I lost a part of myself

The post indicates a loss of a close relationship with the only friend in the poster's current state of residence. This loss has left the poster feeling alone and like they have lost a part of themselves. These feelings of isolation and loss can be indicative of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for mental health issues such as depression and suicidality.
