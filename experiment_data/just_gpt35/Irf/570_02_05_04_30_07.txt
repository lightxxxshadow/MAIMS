Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Just turned midnight here on the east coast. As I head to bed I am... texting with my ex, dreading all the calls I'll have to answer tomorrow, reflecting on all the ways 2017 sucked, and realizing how little I bring to the table as a person.  But nothing will ever change. The cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you are. The thing standing in the way of your dreams is that the person having them is **you**  Not really looking to feel better, just wanted to rant and keep this pity party up for a bit longer. Anyway happy almost 2018, everyone!
