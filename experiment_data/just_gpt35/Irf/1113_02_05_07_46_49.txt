Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm tired of faking confidence, because if you're not confident, no one will talk to you. I'm tired of faking happiness. I'm tired of being me. If you look at my post history, its all just complaining because I have no one else to tell, so I come to reddit. Complaining is all I'm good for. I dont have any worth, and my whole life is evidence that proves it. If I had the balls to actually kill myself, I probably would, but I'm afraid of hurting myself and death. I just can't take it anymore. I know that no one will save me, so I guess I'm just doomed to a life of below negative self esteem, perpetual loneliness and feeling sorry for myself.
