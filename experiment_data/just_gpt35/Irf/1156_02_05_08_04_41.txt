Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  College has been the worst experience for me. I started out at a community college and then transferred to a small city college in my town that I commute to. First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it. Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started. And everyone I went to high school with are graduating now which makes me feel so much worse. I still don't even know what I want to major in. And I really don't want to stay here for two or three more years to finish a degree. Can anyone relate?

The post mentions feelings of isolation, not fitting in, and comparing oneself to others who are graduating. These are all indicators of thwarted belongingness, which refers to the sense of not having meaningful connections or relationships with others.
