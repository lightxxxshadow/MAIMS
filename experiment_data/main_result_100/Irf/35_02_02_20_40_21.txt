Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My girlfriend has depression and I don't know how to deal with it. She becomes sad for no reason, and I didn't know at first, for some reason I thought it was just normal (you know, uhh, girls) so I even felt annoyed (now I feel really bad and guilty though. No need to bash me, internet). But then it gets worse. She says feels like a  piece of shit . That she's worthless and stuff. I didn't know she felt like that because apparently, she was afraid that I would think she was crazy. Any help please?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates that the poster's girlfriend feels like a burden, worthless, and a piece of shit. These are common thoughts associated with perceived burdensomeness, which is a risk factor for mental health problems.

Incorrect
Be careful not to assess the mental health of someone who is not directly providing the information. The post is about the poster's girlfriend, not the poster. Analyse the provided mental scale answers that refer explicitly to the poster's own experiences, and do not make assumptions about the poster's mental health based on their observations of someone else. You need to differentiate between the poster's perspective and the girlfriend's mental state. Review the scale answers again and attempt to answer the question based on the poster's self-report only.

ITER 1
Yes
Based on the answers to the mental scale questions, the poster's responses suggest a high level of perceived burdensomeness. They indicate that the poster feels like they make things worse for the people in their life and rarely interact with people who care about them. These feelings align with the risk of perceived burdensomeness, where individuals may feel like they are a burden on others and that their absence would be a relief. These thoughts could potentially indicate underlying mental health concerns and should be taken seriously.

Incorrect
Ensure to differentiate between the individual discussed in the post and the person answering the scale questions. The poster is speaking about someone else (their girlfriend), not themselves. Review the scale responses carefully and determine whether they are referring to the poster's feelings or to someone the poster describes. Do not attribute the feelings described by the poster about another person to the poster themselves. Instead, analyze the mental health questions based on the actual respondent’s answers. The answers provided to the scale questions suggest the respondent does not feel burdensome, thus the correct answer to the mental health question should be 'No'.

ITER 2
No
The answers provided to the scale questions suggest the respondent does not feel burdensome, thus the correct answer to the mental health question should be 'No'.

Incorrect
Remember not to confuse the perspectives of different individuals in the context. The post discusses the girlfriend's depression and feelings, not the author's. You must analyze the mental health of the person the task refers to, in this case, the author's girlfriend, not the author himself. Revisit the content of the post and the meaning of perceived burdensomeness to reassess your answer.

ITER 3
Yes
The post indicates that the girlfriend feels like a burden, worthless, and that her death would be a relief to the people in her life. These feelings suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a characteristic commonly associated with depression.

Incorrect
Review the source of information carefully before making an inference. The post describes the feelings of the girlfriend, not the poster themselves. Answers from the relevant mental health scale pertain to the poster and indicate no personal feelings of burdensomeness. Your task is to analyze the mental health of the individual in the scale responses, not the person they refer to in their post. To improve, ensure you differentiate between the subject of the post and the subject of the mental health scale answers.

ITER 4
Yes
The post indicates that the girlfriend is feeling like a burden and worthless, which aligns with the concept of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Be careful not to attribute the feelings of individuals around the subject to the subject themself. Analyze the answered questions specifically as they pertain to the individual completing them. In this case, focus on the poster's perspective rather than their girlfriend's mental health. The answered questions suggest the poster does not see themselves as a burden, so your assessment of perceived burdensomeness should reflect that.

ITER 5
Yes
The poster's girlfriend expresses feelings of worthlessness and being a burden, which is indicative of perceived burdensomeness. The poster mentions feeling guilty and wanting to help, implying that they are affected by their girlfriend's emotions and may perceive themselves as a burden in trying to support her.

Incorrect
Be cautious not to confuse the sentiments of people around the poster with the poster's own feelings. The given answers indicate that the poster does not see themselves as a burden, which contrasts with the feelings expressed about their girlfriend's situation. Focus solely on the information pertaining to the individual in question when determining their mental health.

ITER 6
Yes
The post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness because the poster's girlfriend expresses feelings of worthlessness and being a burden, and the poster seeks help in dealing with her depression, indicating a concern about being a burden themselves.

Incorrect
Remember to analyze the post and answered questions separately. Focus solely on the poster's words and feelings, not the girlfriend's. The poster does not express personal feelings of being a burden, rather is concerned about his girlfriend's mental health. Avoid making inferences about the poster's mental state based on the girlfriend's condition. To accurately determine the poster's mental health risk, refer directly to their own statements and answers from the mental scale. The correct answer to the mental health question is 'No' as there is no evidence the poster perceives themselves as a burden.
