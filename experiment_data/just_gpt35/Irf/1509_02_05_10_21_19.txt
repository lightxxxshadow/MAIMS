Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I woke up early this morning in order to do research and perform a workout but ended up breaking down and crying instead. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing the mental fortitude to do most tasks that would supposedly ‚Äúimprove‚Äù my wellbeing. Does anyone know how I‚Äôm supposed to break through this. Every single thing I do is accompanied with a bad memory or thought that just discourages me from doing it and sends me into a depressed state. Please help me, I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm supposed to do things anymore.
