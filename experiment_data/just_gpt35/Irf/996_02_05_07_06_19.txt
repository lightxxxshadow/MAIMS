Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Today had to leave work because my depression was so bad that i started having panic attacks. I couldnt talk to any of my coworkers because if i opened my mouth to talk i would start breaking down. eventually i managed to ask if i could go home early because I wasnt feeling well. I cant even do my job anymore because my depression is so bad.

The post shows signs of thwarted belongingness as the poster describes feeling unable to talk to their coworkers and the difficulty in doing their job due to the severity of their depression. This suggests a lack of connection and support from others, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and detachment.
