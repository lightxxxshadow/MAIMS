The post does not provide enough information to determine if there is a risk of thwarted belongingness. The statement 'This is a daily battle for me' suggests ongoing struggles, but it does not explicitly indicate a lack of social connection or a feeling of being excluded or rejected by others, which are key components of thwarted belongingness.
