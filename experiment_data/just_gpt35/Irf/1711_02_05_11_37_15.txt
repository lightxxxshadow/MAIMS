Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My closest friends have been distant lately. Mostly busy with their jobs, other friends, or partners. I feel they don't really care about me as they're hard to get in contact with. If I gave in to my depression, would they even care that I'm dead?
