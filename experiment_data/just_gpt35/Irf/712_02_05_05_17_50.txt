Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Friendless, depressed, the only thing i had going for myself was that i started sleeping well. Then i found out two days ago i have tinnitus. Tinnitus is a constant buzzing sound in your head that only you can hear. There are no known cures for it, and it lasts forever. I cant be at peace in my own head now. Sleeping is impossible, because the less sound there is, the louder i hear the buzzing. Living is a chore right now. All the emotions i can feel are profound sadness, anger, or complete apathy.

The poster mentions feeling friendless and depressed, which can indicate a lack of social connection and potential thwarted belongingness. This is further supported by the statement that living is a chore and the emotions are mostly negative and apathetic.
