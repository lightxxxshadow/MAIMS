Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Holiday season I have pretty bad depression as it is but when the holidays come around it’s worse. I have a lot of trauma from the holidays as kid involving some shit with my family. I tried to tell my girlfriend but she gets mad at me for “being negative” and that it’s “immature”. How can I try and seem cheerful around this time of year when it’s literally the worst time of the year for me?

The poster explicitly mentions having bad depression, especially during the holiday season. They also mention trauma from the holidays as a child, which can contribute to the development and exacerbation of depression.
