Post:
  I‚Äôm within inches of losing my job. I (M25) spent the last year at this job spiraling in apathy and it‚Äôs catching up with me. I‚Äôve been written up and reprimanded and if I lose this job I‚Äôm gonna lose my house and possibly my wife. Wtf do I do? My depression is just fucking my life up again.

The post indicates that the individual feels overwhelmed by their current situation and sees themselves as a burden to their wife and potentially to others if they lose their job and house. This suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a common component of depressive symptoms.
