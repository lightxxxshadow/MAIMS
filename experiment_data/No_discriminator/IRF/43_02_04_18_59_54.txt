The responses to the questions of the mental scale indicate that the individual feels like a burden on society, thinks their death would be a relief to the people in their life, and believes that the people in their life wish they could be rid of them. These thoughts suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the person perceives themselves as a burden to others and feels that they would be better off without them.
