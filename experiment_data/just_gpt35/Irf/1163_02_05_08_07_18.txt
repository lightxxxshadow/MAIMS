Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It's kind of getting to me. I've never been in a relationship, only been on a date twice, I don't even have that many friends. When my dad was my age he was married and had a kid. I know it's not everything, but I feel like I've done so little and have had such a bad time so far. I've been trying online dating but nobody ever responds to my messages. Sorry if this is a jumble. I needed to vent my thoughts I've been having lately.

The post indicates feelings of inadequacy, comparing oneself to others, and expressing frustration with not being able to form connections. This suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may feel like a burden or believe that they are incapable of forming meaningful relationships or experiences.
