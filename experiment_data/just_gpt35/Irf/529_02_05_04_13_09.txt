Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I had a patient who was unconscious due to a large spontaneous brain hemorrhage. I remember just gazing at their face and thinking, they don't feel anything. Nothing can hurt them or make them feel sad. Part of me wondered whether it would just be better if they didn't wake up at all and I realized that I must be very sad at the moment to think in such a way. Of course I want them to wake up, be well again, and for the medical team to strive to save their life. I'm just really in a sad place right now.

The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness. The poster is expressing sadness and contemplating the patient's lack of pain and suffering, but there is no indication of feeling burdensome or burdensome thoughts towards others.
