Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I recently had to go to the hospital per my therapist (or get IVCd). That was a month ago and nothing has gotten better. No meds have helped and I still find myself planning my death. My psychiatrist prescribes me ambien and I've googled the lethal dosage. I have more than enough. Part of me wants to live but the part that wants to die is bigger. Sadness is like an ocean. Sometimes you swim but right now I'm drowning and I'm not sure there is any coming back from it. Part of me wants to do it in my birthday but I fear that will just devastate my family even more. Sorry for the rant.

The post suggests feelings of isolation and disconnection, as the individual mentions being in the hospital and not experiencing any improvements. They also express a desire to die, which could be indicative of a sense of thwarted belongingness.
