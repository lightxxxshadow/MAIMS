Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I feel like the only reason I haven't already found the courage to do it is my two younger siblings. I'm sixteen, and they are twelve and ten respectively. I know that my parents would be heartbroken, but that would only be two people. My  friends  would be over it in a few weeks anyway. I feel like my brother and sister would be too emotionally damaged or traumatised if I did it, and I don't want to cause any more pain to anyone anymore. This is my first post here, so let me know if I fucked it up. thx
