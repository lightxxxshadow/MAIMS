Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  We were all going to the same school. I don't have any friends beside them. I thought they liked me, because we hung out sometimes, but I've recently discovered that they have been partying all together, without me. New Year's Eve was no exception.

The post suggests that the individual feels excluded and left out from their group of friends who have been partying together without them. This can lead to feelings of perceived burdensomeness, where one may believe that they are a burden or unwanted within the group.
