Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  How much trouble would I be in if I pointed a squirt gun that looked like a real gun at a cop? Assuming that I was shot at but still survived would I get in trouble by the law if they knew that my intentions were suicide and that I had no real weapon?

The post suggests that the individual is contemplating self-harm or suicide and is considering using a potentially dangerous scenario involving law enforcement. This could be seen as a manifestation of perceived burdensomeness, where they may feel like a burden to others and believe that intentionally putting themselves in harm's way would alleviate that burden.
