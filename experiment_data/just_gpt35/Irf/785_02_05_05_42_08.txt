Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Long story short, I have long suspected that I have at least a mild form of depression. I function okay on the day-to-day and present  normal  and am not suicidal, but I go through waves where I become extremely upset (a.k.a. ball my eyes out about the state of my life every few months) and deep down I am pretty chronically unhappy with my life, although I try to avoid thinking about this very often because it just makes me sad. I come from a family of high achievers that doesn't believe in this kind of stuff (if i were to say I am depressed, they will just say you are lazy, in a funk, etc.) and I am broke/do not have health insurance (so therapy/meds out of the question). Is there an online test or something I can take to see if I have depression? Obviously I know it cannot take the place of a medical professional, but that isn't an option for me right now. Thanks for any help and I was so glad to discover this sub!

The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness. The poster mentions feelings of chronic unhappiness and periodic crying spells, but there is no indication of feeling like a burden to others.
