Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  When will this inescapable wait ever end? I feel as though this is never ending and nothing good will ever come out of it. I’m underserving. I have both a long-term mental illness and a long-term physical illness. One’s willpower is limited. I struggle everyday both physically and mentally/emotionally. It’s been years. My physical illness affects my mental illness and vice versa but they are offend uncontrollable! I suffer from chronic low self-esteem due to my illnesses. I don’t know I just feel hopeless and helpless. My willpower feels drained. I don’t know how much longer I can keep holding on. It’s not holding on that’s difficult. What’s difficult is holding on when there may be no meaning to it. What if I hold on with all my will and I find out there’s nothing to it. My whole life would’ve just been meaningless suffering. I keep trying but sometimes it’s really hard and I’m scared and lonely.
