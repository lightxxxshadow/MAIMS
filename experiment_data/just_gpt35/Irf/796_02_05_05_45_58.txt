Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm 23, I have a worthless ass history degree, no physical attraction whatsoever, no real job, no social life, and no hope of getting out of the US because fuck this country. Sure my nieces and nephews might miss me, but they're good kids and they'll get over it when I'm dead. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet, is that I'm too much of a pussy to shoot my empty fuckin head

The post highlights feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, and a desire to escape from the current situation and country. The mention of not being missed by family and contemplating suicide suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a feeling of being disconnected and isolated from others.
