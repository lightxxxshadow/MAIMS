Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My parents fight all the time, Idk if ive been verbally abused or what but my mother yells at me a lot, typically calls me a little shit. i dont really give a fuck about that its just middle school man. Everybody is just so fucking two-faced and even though i have a good amount of friends idk if they are really my friends or what. I really scared myself last week though, had my first suicidal thought. Im not trying to commit suicide yet, the thought has just crossed my mind and i kinda wanna talk about it

The post suggests that the poster is experiencing feelings of isolation, insecurity, and questioning the authenticity of their friendships. The mention of verbal abuse from the mother and having suicidal thoughts indicates a lack of belongingness and potential risk for thwarted belongingness.
