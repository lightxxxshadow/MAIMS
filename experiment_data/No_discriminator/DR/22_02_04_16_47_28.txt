Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  say what You know what? THIS IS FUCKING RIDICOLOUS. I got rejected from yet another interview, although I hate any kind of job - it's all stupid as hell, fuck wageslavery, fuck every company, fuck everyone who plays this psychotic game, and thinks it's what normal people do. Why was I born in a third-world country that won't pay shit for people with severe anxiety like I have. I SIMPLY CAN'T INTERACT WITH PEOPLE, It's not my fault I don't have anything in common with narcisstic crazyass bastards like you. - So when did you graduate? - In 2014 - So what have you been doing this whole time? - I've been doing YOUR MOM. It's none of your business what I have been doing. I've been meditating for the aliens to come and extinct this rotten place you people occupied. Okay, yeah, I admit, I used google translator, goddamnit, for your stupid nonsense article, how fucking awful is that? The translation is accurate and shit. Well, awful enough for the sole reason of using it. Oh well then, sorry for wasting your time. I got rejected from a call-centre - a place where homeless fellows shouldn't go. Things never go my way, man, I cannot stand it, but I'm supposed to, fucking ridicolous. I'm trying so hard to do things I wouldn't recommend to do to anyone who cherishes their mental state, but we are all forced to take part in this stupid  just be happy, smile, reach out, you are worth it, etc  game. Bullshit, euphemisms, THIS IS PURE HUMILATION AND TORTURE; on my terms I wouldn't even ask you how to get to a transport if i got lost in a demons-populated forest. I'm gonna try again, and again, just because it ain't fair, these office-fuckers amuse their little egos by constantly putting me down, cause I let them, but I'm forgiving myself once fucking again. Once again, MOU ICHIDO BOYS, FOR THE GREAT JUSTICE, THE GATES OF HOMELESSNESS AWAIT, ONLY HOLY ONES SHALL ENTER, O-N-C-E A-G-A-I-N, I forgive myself once again ONCE AGAIN
