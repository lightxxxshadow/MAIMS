Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Been feeling detached all my life from everything that make people happy. Not even drugs and alcohol. Also I've been giving less and less fucks about everything. Birthday? Don't care. Christmas? Big deal. New Year's Eve? Just fuck it. I'm supposed to have the time of my life now, but all I have are constant compulsive suicidal thoughts, loneliness/isolation issues, not being able to etc.) So here I sit in the dark, in front of the screen, listening to depressing music, feeling absolutely nothing, but this endless amount of dread and despair from the future. /rant
