Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response  You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen.  He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated. Thank you for at least taking the time to read.
