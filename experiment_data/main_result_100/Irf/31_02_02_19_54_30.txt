Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Welp, just got done with another batch of doctors visits and the results are in, I will be crippled for the rest of my life. But that's not what bothers me, I've had plenty of time to come to terms with my condition and the affect it will have on my quality of life and my life expectancy. What bothers me is the soul crushing loneliness, I havent had a girlfriend in years and I haven't been physically touched in what seems like forever. I spend all day in a shitty little side room by myself writing and hardly see hide nor hair of another person besides my dad most of the time. I'm pretty done with it all to be honest, I don't really see any reason to continue living like this.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates a strong sense of perceived burdensomeness. The poster feels that their death would be a relief to others, thinks they make things worse for people in their life, and expresses feelings of soul crushing loneliness and disconnection from others. These thoughts and emotions suggest a belief that they are a burden to those around them.

Incorrect
Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the provided data. In the answered questions, the poster indicates that they do not believe their death would be a relief to others and do not think they make things worse for those in their life. This suggests that the individual does not perceive themselves as a burden to others in that specific way. When analyzing the content provided, stick closely to the given information and avoid inferring beyond the evidence presented.

ITER 1
Yes
The post indicates feelings of soul crushing loneliness and a lack of social connection, which is a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Avoid confusing social isolation with perceived burdensomeness. While the poster expresses feelings of loneliness and social disconnection, they do not mention feeling like a burden to others. The answered questions specifically indicate the poster does not believe their death would relieve others or that they make things worse for people in their life. Assess each point separately and avoid making assumptions not supported by the information provided.

ITER 2
No
The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness as the poster does not mention feeling like a burden to others. The answered questions specifically indicate that the poster does not believe their death would relieve others or that they make things worse for people in their life. Therefore, it is important to avoid confusing social isolation with perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Review the elements of perceived burdensomeness and consider the poster's expression of being done with it all, their feelings of soul-crushing loneliness, and their lack of supportive relationships. While the poster does not explicitly state they view themselves as a burden, their circumstances and feelings of disconnection could imply a perceived burdensomeness. Analyze the post and scales more deeply for possible implications rather than relying solely on explicit statements.

ITER 3
Yes
The post indicates feelings of soul-crushing loneliness, lack of supportive relationships, and being done with life. The poster expresses not seeing any reason to continue living in their current state. These circumstances, along with the scores on the mental scale (low scores on feelings of belonging, interaction with caring people, and close relationships), suggest a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
Keep focusing on the information provided in the social media post and the relevant mental health scale questions. Continue to carefully determine whether there is any evidence of perceived burdensomeness without overinferring negative characteristics that are not supported by the data. Maintain a balanced approach and consider the actual words and expressed emotions of the poster to avoid bias. Remember to differentiate between the poster's feelings and the possible feelings of people around them, but in this case, your focus was appropriately on the poster's own sentiments. Good job on reaching an informed conclusion based on the available evidence.
