Post:
  It's the same shit every. damn. time. Nothing's gonna change. I'll stay miserable as always. It's always been like this my entire life. There was no hope, I was just delusional. I'm just waiting for the day I can finally kill myself with nothing to stop me.

The post indicates a clear sense of hopelessness, misery, and a desire to end one's life. This suggests a significant lack of belongingness, feeling disconnected from others and unable to find support or meaningful connections. The mention of waiting for the day to kill oneself without any obstacles further highlights an absence of belongingness.
