Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Depression functions in a way where our percieved  rock bottom  always happened somewhere in the past month. The truth is, depression gets worse overtime. That rock bottom that people claim to hit is just an illusion. You are depressed for ten months, feel like you are over it for one month, then sink. You keep sinking farther down into the earth until you reach fucking hell. You keep getting lonelier until you start getting confused whether you're saying stuff in your head or out loud. You grow to be more disgusted by yourself. Your ugly face, your ugly mind, all your fucking failures, and your stupid fucking ego. You feel more and more guilty, regretting every fucking desicion that you make that makes you the stupid failure that you are. You start to cry so much that you can't cry anymore. Soon people don't help your loneliness, compliments don't cure your disgust for yourself, and success doesn't cure your guilt. And the funny thing is, even that isn't rock bottom. Fuck all of those stupid idiots who say it will get better, it only proves how fucking unaware they are to the logical decline that is the essence of depression.
