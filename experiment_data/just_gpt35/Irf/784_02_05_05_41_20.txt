Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Long story short, I have long suspected that I have at least a mild form of depression. I function okay on the day-to-day and present  normal  and am not suicidal, but I go through waves where I become extremely upset (a.k.a. ball my eyes out about the state of my life every few months) and deep down I am pretty chronically unhappy with my life, although I try to avoid thinking about this very often because it just makes me sad. I come from a family of high achievers that doesn't believe in this kind of stuff (if i were to say I am depressed, they will just say you are lazy, in a funk, etc.) and I am broke/do not have health insurance (so therapy/meds out of the question). Is there an online test or something I can take to see if I have depression? Obviously I know it cannot take the place of a medical professional, but that isn't an option for me right now. Thanks for any help and I was so glad to discover this sub!
