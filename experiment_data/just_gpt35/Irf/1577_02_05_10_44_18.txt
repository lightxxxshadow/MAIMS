Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I get some traction every so little to give me a false sense of hope and it comes crashing down. I feel like a pussy for not just ending it right now. Fuck this negative shit. I just want to have a life of fucking happiness but NO! I get to have depression for six years and hope to some god it gets better.
