Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I am getting past the point of wanting to hurt myself. I haven't been touched in years. I have so little self esteem that I haven't even tried to find someone to go out with, mainly because I know that I need to be held so badly that I know I would just come across as creepy and needy. Just being diagnosed as having Asperger's doesn't help at all either. I have a very hard time reading emotions and connecting with people in the first place. Maybe I should just kill myself cause I will never find someone that can put up with my difficulties.
