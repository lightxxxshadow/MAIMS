Yes
The responses to the mental scale questions indicate that the poster perceives themselves as a burden to society, believes they make things worse for the people in their life, and rarely interacts with people who care about them. Additionally, they express feelings of disconnection and isolation from others. These thoughts and feelings suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual perceives a lack of social support and connection, which can contribute to suicidal ideation or self-destructive behaviors.
