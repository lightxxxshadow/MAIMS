The post indicates a perceived burden on the poster's part, as they mention trying their best not to stress their mom but feeling compared and blamed for causing stress. The mention of wanting to grab a bottle of pills and chug it down their throat suggests feelings of hopelessness and potential suicidal ideation, further highlighting the risk of perceived burdensomeness.
