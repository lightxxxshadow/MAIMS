Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  But I don‚Äôt know if I can come back from this. I feel like I have nowhere to turn because I‚Äôve alienated everyone. I‚Äôm sick of being the fuck-up all the time. For everyone else‚Äôs sake i should just do it and not chicken out like last time. I‚Äôm thinking about stealing my roommates bottle of Ativan &amp; taking all of it w/ the liquor I have. It‚Äôs over.
