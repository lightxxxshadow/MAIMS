Post:
  I got my gf pregnant. I don't know what to do and say. I havent slept for 3 days since we found out. She's 4 weeks pregnant and already thinking about  medical abortion . She's not talking to me. I'm having thoughts about killing myself to escape all of this. Its the most dumb thing to do but i feel like im running out of choices. We're not financially stable. I'm a student. I should have wore a condom. What should i do.
