Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel like recently especially I have turned into a robot. While I cry myself to sleep occasionally, over time I've learned to deal with the pain to the point of numbness. Nowadays I feel like I don't have a reaction to anything, nothing burdens me or makes me really happy anymore. It's just always the same blank stare for me.
