Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  For about a year and a half now, I've been having these really bad headaches that usually last for days. Lately they've even gotten so bad that I've passed out. I've seen doctors about it and none of them could find anything wrong, so I was wondering if it might be part of my depression. Does anyone else have this issue?
