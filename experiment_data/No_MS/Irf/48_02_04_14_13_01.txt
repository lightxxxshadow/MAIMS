Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore. Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a year now and in therapy for 2 years. Just putting that out there.

No
The post does not indicate any overt signs of thwarted belongingness. The individual mentions being under the care of a psychiatrist for a year and in therapy for two years, which suggests that they have support and resources in place to address their depression.

Incorrect
Consider the entire content of the post. The individual expresses a lack of interest in most aspects of life except for their job, suggesting feelings of disconnection or isolation, which can be indicators of thwarted belongingness. Analyze the emotional undertones and the implications of the poster's experiences to avoid underestimating potential signs of belongingness issues.
