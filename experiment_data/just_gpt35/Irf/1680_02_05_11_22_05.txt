The poster's feeling of disgust towards their own reflection and avoidance of looking at themselves in a mirror suggest a negative perception of self-image. This may indicate a lack of self-acceptance and a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as they may struggle to feel accepted and connected to others due to their low self-esteem and negative self-perception.
