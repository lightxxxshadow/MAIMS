Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes

  Neither in 2016. Also not in 2015. 2014, whatever. 2013, nope. 2012.. ..2011, nothing. Surely, I stayed alive. Yes, I made a few friends and lost most of them, had relationships and a good day here and there. But in the end, it's 2018 and instead of working on my art and bounding with people over shared experiences, I haven't taken a shower in 6 days. I'd wear my absence of happiness with pride, if it'd just let me focus on the few books I try to read and would let me at least focus enough to document my condition. If I could just accomplish something. Hell, if I could stick to my daily schedule for more than 2 days every month.
