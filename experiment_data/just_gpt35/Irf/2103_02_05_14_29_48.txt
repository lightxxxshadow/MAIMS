Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?

Post:
  Hey ya'll. Happy New Year! I want to recover from depression, but have an odd conundrum. I've been depressed all of my adult life and I worry if I get better from this, what if I do not like the new version of myself? I guess I don't know what part of my personality is a mental illness and what part is actually who I am, and so if I tame the mental illness then what if I don't like the version of me that's left? Has anyone felt like this, and if so how did you approach the recovery process? I cannot afford medication or therapy so I am in the process of making my own plan of action to help me out until I can find a therapist on a sliding scale (the waiting lists are a bitch where I live for this sort of thing). Any advice would be much appreciated.

The poster expresses concerns about not liking the new version of themselves if they recover from depression. This suggests a fear of burdening others with their presence or their changed self.
