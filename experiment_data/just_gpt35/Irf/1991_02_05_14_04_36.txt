Post:
  Everyone's out there celebrating. People you know brandishing how far they've come and how they're gonna take control of the upcoming year. Bring in more blessings. Get more out of life. While I'm here. I've slept all day. I've been stuck in my bed for days. And I'm probably just gonna sleep again and try to forget I'm living this useless life. I've been here for years. And I haven't moved. I'm fucking miserable. Nothing's changed and nothing probably will.
