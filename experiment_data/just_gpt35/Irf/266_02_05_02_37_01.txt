Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Everyone has one as far as ive seen except me, i know thats not true but thats all my brain is telling me. I dont wanna complain like a child but fuck its stupid. Why cant someone call me up just to talk or to just see if i can play video games or just to see how im doing. Why do i call  my friends  every year on their birthdays when they dont even remember mine. If this is how its gunna be the why do i still care for people around me when it seems like they couldnt give a shit about me.
