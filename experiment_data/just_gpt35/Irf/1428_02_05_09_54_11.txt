Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Honestly it‚Äôs just constant exhaustion and pain and stress, it‚Äôs too much for me to handle. I can‚Äôt handle this drag we call life, going to school every morning, going home and studying, dealing with my father, it‚Äôs all just too much. I can‚Äôt do it on my own but I can‚Äôt ask others to save me either, well there isn‚Äôt really one that exists sadly. I guess I‚Äôll just be alone for some more years : (.
