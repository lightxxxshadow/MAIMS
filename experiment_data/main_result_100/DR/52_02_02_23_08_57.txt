Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
Based on the answered questions of the mental scale, the poster expresses feelings of sadness, pessimism, past failure, guilty feelings, self-dislike, and worthlessness. These are common symptoms of depression, indicating that the poster may be suffering from depression.

Incorrect
Be cautious not to diagnose without comprehensive assessment. The evidence from the social media post and answered questions indicates symptoms associated with depression, such as sadness, pessimism, and feelings of worthlessness. However, proper diagnosis requires a structured clinical interview and cannot be made solely on this basis. Avoid over-inference or assuming characteristics not explicitly stated. Focus on objectively reported feelings and behaviors without adding attributions about the individual's character or unstated experiences.

ITER 1
Yes
Symptoms associated with depression, such as sadness, pessimism, and feelings of worthlessness are indicated in the post and the answered questions.

Correct
Ensure that you consistently cross-reference the social media post with the answers from the mental health scale. Avoid over-inferencing by only drawing conclusions based on provided evidence. Focus on specific indicative symptoms mentioned in both the post and the scale responses, like sadness, discouragement about the future, feelings of guilt, self-dislike, irritability, and fatigue. Avoid attributing symptoms or inferring issues that are not explicitly mentioned or supported by the scale responses. Continue to differentiate between the poster's emotions and the emotions or mental states of others mentioned in the post. Remember to always remain objective and rely on the information given.
