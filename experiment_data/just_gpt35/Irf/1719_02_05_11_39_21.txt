Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It's big day for me and I feel guilty for not being happy and not wanting to enjoy it but all I want to do is to shut myself off from everyone and sleep. I remember I used to be so happy about my birthday coming up but now I just don't want to celebrate it anymore.

The poster expressing feelings of guilt, not wanting to enjoy their birthday, and wanting to isolate themselves could indicate a perceived burdensomeness.
