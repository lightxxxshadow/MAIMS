Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Friend leads much better life, I feel resentful We both just graduated, she had so many job offers, I had none save for an internship. I found a job later but I make less than half of what she makes. She got a job offer from another firm, and referred me to them when she turned them down, but I didn't get it even though the interview went great. And because she makes so much more than I do, she's always trying to get me to travel, which I can't afford since I'm saving up for grad school. She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works. She's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around. It's getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while I have nothing to compare, how shitty of a person would I be if I distanced myself from her for my own mental well-being?

The poster expresses feelings of resentment, envy, and inadequacy due to the comparison with their friend's achievements. This may indicate low self-esteem or dissatisfaction with their current situation. However, it is important to note that these feelings do not necessarily indicate the presence of depression. Depression is a complex mental health condition that involves multiple symptoms and requires a thorough assessment by a mental health professional.
