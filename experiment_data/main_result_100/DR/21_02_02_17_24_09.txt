Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  No friend left behind? *short* I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least). Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship. Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her. I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way. I feel like if they didn’t want to be friends anymore they should say something to her to give her a fair chance. Am I overthinking this or on track?
