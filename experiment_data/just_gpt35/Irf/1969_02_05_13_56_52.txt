Post:
  when a normal person would cry and you get the sadness and the feeling of crying and you double over and clench your fists and grind your teeth and do anything to make yourself cry because you can't. fucking. cry. ?? does that have a word? not-crying? self-harm? what the fuck is this thing? i've been doing it for 6 years now without ever stopping to wonder what the fuck it actually is.

The post does not explicitly indicate risk of perceived burdensomeness. The person is expressing frustration and difficulty in experiencing crying, but it does not necessarily suggest a feeling of being a burden on others or a desire to relieve others of that perceived burden.
