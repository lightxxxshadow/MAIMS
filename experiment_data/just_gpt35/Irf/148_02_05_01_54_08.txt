Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I started my job a couple months ago. I have worn a sweater over my work shirt or long sleeves with it to cover my scars. I know that I shouldn't be ashamed of them, but I often feel that way. However, today I decided to say fuck it and just wear short sleeves. I was uncomfortable and didn't want anyone to notice, but I'm still glad I did it.

The post suggests that the person feels shame about their scars and has been concealing them at work. This desire to hide their scars may indicate a fear of rejection or not fitting in, which aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
