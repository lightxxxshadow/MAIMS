Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  These past two years have been such a letdown for how little I've gotten done. But even worse, who I thought I was turned our to be wrong. I need purpouse. I need the story of my life to, for one actually read like a story, and to have a meaning. I have absolutely no clue how to live without that emotional connection to who I am and the pride that comes with that.
