Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  How much trouble would I be in if I pointed a squirt gun that looked like a real gun at a cop? Assuming that I was shot at but still survived would I get in trouble by the law if they knew that my intentions were suicide and that I had no real weapon?
