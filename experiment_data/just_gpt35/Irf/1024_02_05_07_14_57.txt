Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My cousin died last weekend. My dad and I did not attend the funeral because he molested me when I was a kid. My family is angry with us.... particularly my dad. There has been a rift for years and recently it felt like it was getting better but now it's all fucked again. Ever since he died I've had an overwhelming amount of emotions some angry, mostly angry.. now I feel sad for being the root cause of this rift. My family is angry and I can't tell them why. I don't want to and honestly what good would it do now. I'd rather just deal with it and move on. I feel like it's all my fault. Everything feels overwhelming I just feel like I can't.
