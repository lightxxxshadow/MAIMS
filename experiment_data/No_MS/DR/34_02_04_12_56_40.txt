Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Tomorrow is my 35th birthday. So tomorrow is my 35th birthday. I really thought I would have a family, have a husband or wife and just be happy having this awesome life. Nope. At 35, I am miserably in debt, unhappy, no family and I'm very far from all of my friends. So, yay I guess.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster expresses feelings of unhappiness, loneliness, and being in debt which are common symptoms of depression.

Incorrect
Avoid making definitive diagnoses based on a single social media post. The poster does show signs of distress, but diagnosing depression requires a thorough assessment by a professional. Instead, consider discussing the signs and suggesting the poster may benefit from seeking a professional evaluation.

ITER 1
Yes
The poster expresses feelings of unhappiness, loneliness, and being in debt. The mention of not having a family or being far from friends suggests a lack of social support. These symptoms align with the criteria for depression, but a definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on this single post.

Incorrect
Avoid making definitive conclusions about mental health without thorough assessment. Expressing feelings of unhappiness or loneliness in one post does not suffice for a depression diagnosis. Consider the limitations of a single social media post and refrain from over-inference. Look for consistent patterns over time or additional information before suggesting a mental health condition.

ITER 2
No
Expressing feelings of unhappiness or loneliness in one post does not suffice for a depression diagnosis. Additional information is needed.

Correct
While you have made a correct assessment in this case, it's important to continue to avoid over-inferencing from limited information and to distinguish between the feelings of the individual posting and those around them. Ensure any conclusions about mental health are based on consistent, substantial evidence.
