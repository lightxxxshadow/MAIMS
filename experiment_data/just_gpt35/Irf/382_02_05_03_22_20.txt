Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I do. Every time I look back on my past and even in my present I try to justify my shitty behavior because I keep thinking that maybe I'm just a good person on the inside. I treat my family and friends like shit and get angry at them for things that are mostly my fault. I feel like I'm not the person I thought I was.

The post indicates a sense of feeling disconnected and distant from family and friends, as well as expressing self-blame and guilt for treating them poorly. These feelings and behaviors suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is characterized by a perceived lack of social support and a sense of not fitting in or being understood by others.
