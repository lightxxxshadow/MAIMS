  Maybe I Should post this to suicidal watch or whatever. But I prefer you people. Like why should I work my ass for minum wage, Why should I eat healthy If I dont enjoy it because i feel better drinking whiskey and eating pizza all day. Why the fuck should I be polite to people that I dont give a fuck too even my own family. Everyone Is fake. Hi how are you. Like you give fuck or they do. Just get straight to the point mate. haha Like why the fuck am I forced to live a never ending nightmare. Or ur mum would be sad etc why the fuck arnt they happy that i am dead. Don't they want me to end my suffering. I cant live much longer like this its rotting my brain. I started cuting my self and u know what it actually feels good. Hopefully in the future i can take it a step further and actually kill myself. Sorry the rant but why the should i be here im not going to make a differnce i have no hobbies I dont enjoy anything so why the fuck am i still here... I legit appreicate all the people that volunteer there the people that need rewarding yet most of them are struggling with dead end jobs legit.I just want to die its that simple but im scared of the pain why isnt there a easy solution. sorry for the rant and gramamr blah blah blah haha hope u peeople have a good new year unlike me :^)))))))))))) go get wasted people :)

The post indicates a feeling of isolation and disconnection from others. The poster expresses a lack of desire to interact with people, including their own family, and describes everyone as fake. They also mention not feeling supported or understood, questioning why people would care if they were no longer alive. This suggests a risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual feels a lack of social connection and meaningful relationships.
