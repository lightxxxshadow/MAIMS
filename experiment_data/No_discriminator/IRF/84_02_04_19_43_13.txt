The responses to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13 indicate feelings of being a burden on others, believing that others would be better off without them, thinking about death as a relief, feeling disconnected from others, and perceiving oneself as an outsider in social gatherings. These responses suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a perception of being socially disconnected and lacking a sense of belonging.
