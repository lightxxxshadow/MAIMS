The post expresses feelings of pain, misery, and a lack of happiness, indicating a sense of dissatisfaction and a desire for belongingness and happiness.

This indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, where they may feel disconnected and unfulfilled in their relationships and social interactions.
