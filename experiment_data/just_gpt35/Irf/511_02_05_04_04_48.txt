Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I wish I had the courage to open up about my depression. It's my birthday today and it feels like the most miserable day of my life. 21 years old and nothing to show for it. It eats me up inside when I bottle up my emotions and I desperately want to talk to my friends and family but I feel like it would make me a massive burden, or that I'm just looking for sympathy.
