Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I hate myself so much and everyone hates me too even my own boyfriend. He doesn‚Äôt say it but I could tell he thinks I‚Äôm terrible and miserable and that he‚Äôs better than me. Why is it so hard to take care of myself? I just want to be dead already so I don‚Äôt have to do eat, exercise, shower... why are these things so god damn hard for me and so easy for everyone else? I‚Äôm such a fucking burden and everyone knows I‚Äôm a stupid piece of shit. Why won‚Äôt god just let me die
