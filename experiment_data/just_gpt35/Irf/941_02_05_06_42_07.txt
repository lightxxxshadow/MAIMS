Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Moving back home isn't an option. I won't be able to get and hold a job for much the same reason I can't graduate - an inability to be among others for any notable amount of time. I had hoped to get a stay at home job upon graduating, but without a degree that possibility is closed to me. I have roughly $20k to my name and my expenses are minimal. All I want is to keep to myself and not constantly worry about food and shelter, but I know nothing about essentials such as cooking or apartment searching. Is there any hope that I'm not seeing or do I only have a year left to live?

The poster expresses feelings of being unable to hold a job or graduate due to an inability to be around others for a notable amount of time. They also mention not wanting to constantly worry about food and shelter, and feeling hopeless about their future. These factors suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may feel like they are a burden to others due to their difficulties and lack of independence.
