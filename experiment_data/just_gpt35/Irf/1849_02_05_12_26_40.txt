Post:
  That's all I can really say. Nothing is worth the effort... I don't think I am capable of taking steps to improve my life, because I just don't even fucking care. Whatever I'm doing, wherever I go in my life, I'll find a way to be miserable. Why try... I just... ugh...

The post indicates a lack of motivation and an overall sense of hopelessness. The poster conveys a belief that they are burdensome and that their efforts to improve their life will be futile. This suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a component of several mental health disorders such as depression or suicidal ideation.
