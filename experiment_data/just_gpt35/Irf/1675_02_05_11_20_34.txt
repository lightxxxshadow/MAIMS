True Label:	No
Post:
  I thought this year was going to be different. I thought I was finnaly going to be happy for once in my life. I thought this girl was going to be the answer I was looking for.. instead I am chasing someone that just made me irrelevant. I guess college does change someone, or I probably Fucked up somewhere along the way. Who knows! I guess I just wasn't good enough......

The poster's statement of feeling irrelevant and not being good enough suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a common feature of mental health problems such as depression or low self-esteem.
