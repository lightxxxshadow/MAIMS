Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I've always felt like emotions are hard for me, I always smile but thats just to make other people feel at ease around me. when something bad happens I rarely cry, I do feel aching in my heart and know that its sad I just don't feel like crying is the right way to react. Is this something you have felt? How do you get along with it? TLDR. I know emotions and know when I should be doing them but i cannot cry when I'm sad and I rarely laugh when I'm happy

The post does not provide sufficient information to determine if there is a risk of perceived burdensomeness. The individual mentions difficulty expressing emotions and not crying when sad, but it does not necessarily indicate feelings of burden on others or perceiving oneself as a burden.
