Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore. Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a year now and in therapy for 2 years. Just putting that out there.

Yes
The poster's responses to the questions indicate a high risk of perceived burdensomeness. They express feeling disconnected from others, often feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and rarely interacting with people who care about them. Additionally, they do not feel like they belong and do not have satisfying interactions. These feelings of isolation and lack of support can contribute to a perception of being a burden on others.
