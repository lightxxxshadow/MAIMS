Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hey, guys! I've been looking at myself and trying to figure out why I am a wreck. A procrastinating, depressed wreck. And I figured it out. I have too many HUGE ambitions, ambitions which take a lot of time and I need to get through the beginning, but I can't. And that depresses me. I feel down for not being able to do all those big things that I want to do. So is there a known way to learn how to control ambitions? (Some of those ambitions are caused from maladaptive daydreaming)
