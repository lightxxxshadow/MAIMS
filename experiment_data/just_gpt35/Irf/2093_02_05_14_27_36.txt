Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My partner and I recently moved across country. I was doing so well up until now. No homesickness, not even really upset about leaving, found a job, trying to make friends. Then I wake up one morning and can't stop crying. Pull myself together and go to work. Next morning same thing. Just super emotional but also numb inside. I'm lonely and I feel like I can't even really talk about it. I'm supposed to be having this huge life adventure and I just wake up crying all the time. Don't know what to do.
