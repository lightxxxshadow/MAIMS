Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I don't know if it's the anxeity disorder or what, but lately I've been thinking for some reason that my life is gonna be short and end with a tragic and traumatic death. It's been kind of scaring me lately. I've also been having dreams about car crashes to the point I'm scared to drive farther than 5 minutes from my house. It may seem stupid but I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this before.
