Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  [I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences] I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety. For the first week I was prescribed 5mg, 10mg thereafter. It's been two days and I have this mild feeling like I'm on ecstasy/MDMA. My body feels light and I have this weird concentration of energy above my neck at the back of my head. Has anyone felt this/experienced this?

Based on the answered questions of the mental scale, the poster's responses indicate feelings of disconnection, being an outsider in social gatherings, and not having satisfying interactions. These feelings align with a higher risk of perceived burdensomeness, as individuals who feel disconnected and believe they make things worse for others may perceive themselves as burdensome.
