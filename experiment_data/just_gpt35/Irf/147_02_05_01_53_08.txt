Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  No one in my family knows. The days I wake up so late because it's impossible to wake up. All the student loan debt that is creeping on my back and I still haven't graduated yet. All the failed classes because I just can't focus anymore. I've really never known what to do and nobody in my family knows. Wondering if there are other people like me out there
