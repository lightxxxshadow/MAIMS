Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Today I gave up. Just got back the results after retaking a test and scored another F. And so I am formally announcing giving up on my education and getting a low-entry job and just being content with that for the rest of my life. I've been depressed for a while now, and self-medicating with alcohol. Somedays just seem to pass on autopilot, I don't even notice the day has passed until I look outside and see it's already dark out. So I'm back to jobseeking once again, and experiencing incredible anxiety about telling my family about my failure, they've been really supportive of me  taking life into my own hands  and striving to do better with my education. Truth be told it was a half-assed attempt and I barely studied at all. Spent my time playing games or wallowing in self pity most of the time. Yesterday I googled something that vaguely described how I felt and landed on [this page](http://www.getesteem.com/lse-symptoms/symptom-details.html) and it resonated so hard with me I broke down into tears. I feel like a mess. Everything is just really overwhelming right now.

The poster expresses feelings of failure, giving up, self-medication with alcohol, depression, and anxiety about telling their family. They also mention feeling overwhelmed and like a mess. These factors suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual may feel like a burden to others due to their difficulties and failures.
