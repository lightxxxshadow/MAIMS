Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I was about 12 I've had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I don't have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it's actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I've always had a slight superiority complex. I don't hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I've always been the life of the party, but deep down I don't ever remember being happy. As someone who's highly ambitious, it feels as if there's a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread. Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I've been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I've considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I'm not a very emotional person. I've come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I've always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content.
