  I'm supposed to take one pill every night to help me sleep but I wonder if I just fucking take like 5. I don't give a shit. No one else gives a shit either. Maybe tomorrow it'll be 2, the the next day 6 then maybe I'll do 9 if I'm still alive. I dont care. Nothing feels good.

The post suggests feelings of isolation and a lack of support from others, as the person expresses indifference towards their own well-being and the lack of concern from others. This aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness, which refers to feeling disconnected or excluded from social relationships.
