Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  How do you deal with depressed parents? Should I recommend they talk to a therapist or a doctor? She tells me the only reason she lives is because of me, her son. I know if I left, it would devastate her, but I want to live in a different part of the country, on my own. What do I do?

The post suggests that the person's parent relies heavily on them for their well-being and expresses fear and guilt about leaving. This demonstrates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, where the individual feels trapped in a situation that prevents them from pursuing their own desires and goals.
