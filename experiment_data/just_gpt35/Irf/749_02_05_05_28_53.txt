Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I am literally useless. I can't function. Haven't left my house for 2 weeks. I have no confidence. Every time I get a positive belief about myself, my anxiety turns it into an insecurity. I get suicidal thoughts 24/7 and I can't even do things for others because I stress out too much and make it a chore for them. No matter whati I do everything is bad. I want to be normal.
