Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  There are things I'd like to do sure...but this divorce has broken me. I'm tired of crying all day at work. I'm tired if not wanting to get out of bed. I'd like to try...but I'm not sure I'm capable. My motivation is completely gone. He stole every dream I had and told me to keep walking. Heartless. And I feel heartless now too. Empty. And I just want to stop feeling it.

The poster expresses feelings of being broken, tired, and lacking motivation. They mention feeling empty and wanting to stop feeling, which suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection from others. These feelings align with the concept of thwarted belongingness, which refers to a perceived lack of social connection or fulfillment of belonging needs.
