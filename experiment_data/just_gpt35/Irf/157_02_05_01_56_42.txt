Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Finally went to the doc after being in a nine month low, the lowest I've been in years. I started meds and my doc just upped them after my three week check up. She also gave me a pill to stop panic attacks. I thought I was making strides forward. Today my dad's girlfriend, a very nice and loving woman, died. She died the exact same way my mom died almost exactly six years later. I remained calm for him, but I'm having a terribly hard time. I'm just numb. I just don't fucking understand. Death just follows me. I don't know what to do. My boss told me to take tomorrow off. My dad lives 3 hours away and is snowed in so I can't really even go visit him. I'm drowning.
