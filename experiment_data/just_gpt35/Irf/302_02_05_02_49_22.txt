Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Tonight my roommates and I watched a movie together, then they left to go have dinner with her parents. And I sat at home and cried. I left my job 2 weeks ago, but no one has called me back about my resume. I barely eat, but am gaining weight. I'm tired yet oversleeping. My dad told me that the doctors give him a year, maybe. It's all so much. I'm so... not done. I can't say done. Done is... not an option. So... here's to a better year. Here's to the last year ill have with my dad. I want to make it a good one.

The post indicates a sense of loneliness and isolation, as the poster's roommates have left and they are left alone to cry. They also mention feeling tired, oversleeping, and not being done, indicating a lack of motivation or purpose. These feelings and experiences align with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
