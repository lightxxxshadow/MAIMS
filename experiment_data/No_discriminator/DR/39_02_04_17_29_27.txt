Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Almost everything that I used to care for is simply starting to have no meaning. I feel dead and lifeless. I used to be very passionate with certain things but that was usually meant with me being bashed and shunned upon people. Or simply just a turn off. Everyday I wake up and I’m angry. Always wondering what the hell the point of this is. Why I’m here. I used to be extremely suicidal in the past and I’m slowly falling into that dark pit again. I don’t know what to do. It’s so hard to be happy and I’m just... I’m starting to give up.
