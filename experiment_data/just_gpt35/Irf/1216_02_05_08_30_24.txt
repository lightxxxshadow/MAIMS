Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  So for the last year I've been suicidal and knew I needed to get help but couldn't afford it. I had an idea to ask my parents to use their health insurance since in still on it to get me to see someone, but was terrified to tell my mom her little boy was so broken. Well tonight I did it and cannot believe how understanding she was. Turns out depression runs in the family and she's been secretly seeing someone for years! For all those struggling - it's okay to ask for help. You deserve to be happy and if that means opening up about your struggles to loved ones, all the power to you! I love you guys!
