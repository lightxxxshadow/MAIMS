Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Not allowed to feel bad? I feel like I'm not allowed to feel bad. I'm an unimportant piece of shit and there are so many other people that need help and all the other people are a lot more important than me. I'm not considered as a person, I'm just something to use to pull yourself up. It's like I'm stuck in a swamp and all the people step on me and push me deeper down just to get out themselves. I guess I don't deserve to feel good. Noone will care if I will kill myself. They'll just use another person.

Yes
The poster expresses a sense of worthlessness, hopelessness, and mentions thoughts of suicide, which are common symptoms of depression.

Correct
While your response is correct, remember to remain cautious about making definitive diagnoses purely based on a social media post. A mental health professional would need to conduct a thorough assessment to confirm depression. However, the poster's language does indicate signs of depressive symptoms. For future tasks, maintain a balance between what is expressed and avoid making assumptions beyond the provided information. Always consider recommending professional help when encountering indications of suicidal ideation or severe distress.
