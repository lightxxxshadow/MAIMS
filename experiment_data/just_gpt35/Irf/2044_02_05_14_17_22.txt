Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  So for the last two years I thought I had depression. A few days ago I was diagnosed with depression. I'm starting to think I don't have depression and I'm just a bitch and I don't know how to tell if that's the case. The weirdest thing is, over the last month I've been increasingly feeling well. My life is shit becausd I missed lits of school and so I worry a lot, but that's normal. Other than that I feel.. fine. I don't feel depressed. Could it be that this is temporary or does this mean I don't have depression. The other thing is I was given pills but the thing is I don't want to take pills that might fuck me if I'm feeling ok atm. Advice?????? I need to make some decisions fast

The post does not show any indication of thwarted belongingness. The poster is questioning their diagnosis of depression and expressing uncertainty about their mental state, but there is no mention of feeling socially isolated or lacking a sense of belonging.
