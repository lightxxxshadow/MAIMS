The poster's responses to the questions indicate strong feelings of worthlessness, self-hatred, and a belief that they are a burden on others. They express a desire to disappear and feel like an outsider. These thoughts and emotions are consistent with the concept of thwarted belongingness, as they reflect a deep sense of disconnection and disengagement from meaningful social relationships.
