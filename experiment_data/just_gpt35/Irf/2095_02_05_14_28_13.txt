True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm 16 years old kiddo and diagnosed with deep depression along with SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder). It's so hard to talk with people or even go out but today i made my first move and went to school where i haven't gone for almost 2 years. Now i'm making my way up to get benzodiazepams for *SAD* I hope everything goes well and i can go out with friends again cause i barely remember my last time i went out with friends :( my relatives think i'm just lazy but they dont understand how hard it is for me to talk to people or even go out, i get like mini panic attack when i come contact with stranger and it feels awful. Oh mann im just so tired of this shyt

The post indicates that the person is feeling burdened by their mental health struggles, as they express frustration, fatigue, and difficulty in engaging with others. They also mention wanting benzodiazepams to cope with their social anxiety. These factors suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is the belief that one's presence or actions are a burden to others.
