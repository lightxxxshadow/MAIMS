Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  It was not to long ago until I realised how lonely I am. I hang out with same 4 friends every time who I'm not comfortable with sharing anything because they are immature and make fun out of every little thing their is. Girls don't want to hang out with me because I'm not a typical douchebag like almost everyone. I would ask them out just so we could chat, but that isn't working out. With that being all said I developed this  someone  with who I talk to. Coming from a religious family I have grown up to believe in God, so I think I relate this someone with God. I tell all my problems and I request they would go away. My problems only got worse and worse so one night when I was on the edge of breaking down I realised I'm actually talking to no one but myself. When I actually came to this conclusion I fucking broke down pretty hard. Tears were running down my face and all I could think about is how much of a baby I am. I started hitting myself so it would go away. When I started to physically hurt myself I told myself it's enough, go get some help. I know the internet isn't the best place to be around in a situation like this, but there is still enough hope left in me for me to believe there is someone who can relate to me. These are all new stuff I'm experiencing since I never had problems like this. Sorry for the long post, but I actually think I'm going mental.

The post indicates feelings of loneliness, desperation, and a sense of burden. The poster expresses difficulty in sharing their problems with friends and feeling rejected by potential romantic partners. They also mention talking to someone as a way to cope with their problems but later realize they are actually talking to themselves. The mention of physically hurting themselves suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.
