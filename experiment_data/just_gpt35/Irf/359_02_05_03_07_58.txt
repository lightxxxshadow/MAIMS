Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I wanna ask you because for some time now I've been trying to be less cynical and do stuff other people like but I just cannot understand why are they doing all of this? I hate facebook , I hate memes ,I hate internet culture and it annoys me to see people embracing it and not even being able to make a normal conversation just talk about memes on the internet , stupid youtube videos and shows that they binge watch in a day and don't have any valueable opinion on it just saying that they liked it or not . Am I just a cynical cunt ? PS: By the way I'm posting this qustion here because this stuff is quite a big reason of my lolieness and depression , you know I just can't find anybody to connect with and it's not like I automaticly cross the person off for liking this stuff , I'm trying to get to know them and it turns out that they're just a frankenstein of all the popculture they absorbed and they cannot hold a conversation even for a little while.

The post indicates a feeling of isolation and difficulty in finding connections with others due to differing interests and values. The poster expresses frustration towards popular culture and the inability of others to engage in meaningful conversations outside of internet trends. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual views themselves as a burden or unable to connect with others effectively.
