Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I just want to sleep all the time because if I'm sleeping, I'm not hurting. I'm too young to drink legally and I don't currently have a fake so I can't really self-medicate with alcohol too frequently. I'm about to go on a higher dose of meds which will hopefully numb me out more. Lately my main way has been escaping all negative thoughts through sleeping or video games. Maybe going back to college in a few weeks will help me? Idk. I want some suggestions for dealing with pain
