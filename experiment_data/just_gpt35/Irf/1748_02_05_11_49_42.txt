Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Today has been the worst fucking day I've had in a long time without getting into details due to legal reasons. I already feel like I've just been  here  and drifting along almost like a zombie for the past 6 years and don't know if I can keep going on. I know the pain I'll leave behind but I don't know if my soul/heart can take this anymore

The mention of feeling like a zombie and the consideration of leaving behind pain suggests a sense of loneliness and lack of connection with others, which indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness.
