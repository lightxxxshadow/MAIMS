Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I tried, I tried and I tried but I just can't take the final step. First with my dad's shotgun and the last two times I tried to hang myself on new years. It's like survival instinct kicks in in the last second. I want to die so fucking bad. I want to be mugged and get shot after resisting. I want to die in a car crash. I want to have a terminal disease. I want to reach out for a cop's gun. I fantasize about all the ways to die. But I just can't do it myself. Am I going to be stuck with me and be miserable for the rest of my life? Can you be a perfect functional member of society if you are depressed?
