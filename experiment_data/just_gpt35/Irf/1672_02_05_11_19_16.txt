Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I fucking whine and moan about how I want to kill myself, but I know I'm too pussy to actually fucking do it. I'm an asshole who people don't like. You've made nobodies 2016 better, and nobody wants you in there 2017. Nobody invited you to a party, nobody ever will. You're pathetic. Why would people want to be with a sad sack of shit who has no positive qualities. I have nothing I'm good at, and the one thing I'm interested in I absolutely blow at. I'm a loser. Nobody loves you, hell, nobody even *likes* you. You're garbage. You're a fucking idiot. I hate you so much, I hate that you can't even kill yourself. Fuck you and everything you stand for: whining, complaining, cynicism, pessimism. All you do is bring and tear people down. Why is the only time you can be fun and happy and optimistic are when you're drunk? Fuck I suck. I hate myself so much. Here's to another garbage fucking year, hopefully I don't live to see the end of it.

The language used in the post suggests a deep sense of isolation and rejection. The poster expresses feelings of being unwanted and disliked by others, emphasizing their belief that nobody loves or even likes them. This indicates a significant risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological state characterized by a perceived lack of social connection and a strong desire for meaningful relationships.
