Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  There are so many things I want to say to people, things I want to type... But in the end, no matter how much of that text I wrote or how much I think about what to say, I delete it in the end. I'm sure I'm not alone in this regard, but I feel like 90% of all potential comments and posts on reddit I make are deleted before I post them.  Somebody else probably said it already.   Nobody cares what I have to say anyway.  Just things like that. Lots more too, but I'm just going to post this now while I still have the nerve to do it.

The poster's feelings of low self-worth, self-doubt, and believing that nobody cares about what they have to say are indicative of depressive symptoms. The constant deletion of their comments and posts also suggests a lack of motivation and a negative mindset commonly associated with depression.
