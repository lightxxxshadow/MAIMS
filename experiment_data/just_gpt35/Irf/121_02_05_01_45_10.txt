The post suggests a feeling of worthlessness and self-perceived burden, as the poster expresses that they don't deserve anything and views their problems as trivial and stupid. The mention of deleting their post and referring to themselves as a 'pile of shit' also indicates a negative perception of self and potential thoughts of being a burden to others.
