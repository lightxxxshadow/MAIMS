Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Do you ever secretly hope you get cancer? Do you ever go to sleep and console yourself with pretty thoughts as you close your eyes Do you ever desperately pray every night to wake up with brain cancer So you can go Peacefully FFS. My wrists are patched today but deep down I know if I really was brave enough I would have gone completely. Now I have to face people wearing the fucking bandages and they will all pretend they didn't notice and it will be fucking awkward And the worst part is I am still here If it was cancer they would cry a bit and buy me a drink and say 'how tragic' when I finally go My heart breaks for all the precious souls trapped in bodies struck by that horrible desease, while my own body stubbornly keeps existing and breathing and providing home for this rotten mind and filthy soul and I feel I've ripped off everyone that could use this body and it's so disgustingly unfair I really, really want to go. But I am a coward and I am trapped.
