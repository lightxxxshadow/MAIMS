Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I don‚Äôt like people. I have isolated myself from the outside world for over six years now. I don‚Äôt want to have long conversations with no one. I just need the strongest meds I can get to combat my issues. Before I try something illegal which I have been tempting to use for some time now. Is there a way for me to achieve this without having to see a psychologist? Sorry if I‚Äôm coming off a certain way. I‚Äôm just tired and need help.
