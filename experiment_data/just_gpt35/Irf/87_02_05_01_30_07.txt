Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm frustrated with my life. I have very few friends, and as a 20 year old college student about to turn 21 it‚Äôs driving me crazy to realize that I can‚Äôt celebrate it with anyone. My closest friends are all younger than me, and 2 of the closest are 16 (don‚Äôt worry, I met them through my job, I‚Äôm not a pedophile), so I feel pathetic for being unable to make friends my own age. It‚Äôs just plain creepy. Only thing that keeps people from calling me out is that I look only a year older than them. I‚Äôm gay, in a hyper conservative family, so I can‚Äôt please anyone in it. I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I‚Äôm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I‚Äôm gay, I‚Äôm a pedophile. The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting. I try approaching the LGBT groups on campus but I feel like they‚Äôll ostracize me for other reasons. I feel like I was cheated my teenage years by my restrictive parents, now I‚Äôm lonely and angry at everyone around me for having what I couldn‚Äôt. My siblings are successful, and I feel like the dissappointment and failure of the family. I have much more anger but these are the ones that keep popping up today, and I just wanted to vent about it somewhere.

The post shows a sense of burdensomeness as the poster feels like the disappointment and failure of their family and expresses anger at everyone around them for having what they couldn't. They also mention feeling restricted and isolated due to their conservative family's beliefs and lack of friends their own age. These factors contribute to a perception of being a burden to others.
