Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I don't enjoy the  nice  things other people seem to enjoy. Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is  How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing.  Especially reading a book. Dear God, I could never distract myself from the disconnect I feel inside of me to enjoy reading a book Why don't I get that little rush of dopamine from behavior others find rewarding?
