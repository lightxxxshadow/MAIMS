  I‚Äôve grown disgusted with myself and hating myself. Nothing i can say can seem to right the wrongs i‚Äôve done, and i‚Äôm paying for it now by losing relationships with all the ones i love. I don‚Äôt see any future where things can be mended. I‚Äôm out of ideas, and don‚Äôt want to go on anymore.
