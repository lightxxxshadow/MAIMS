  I'll be using a certain method that is inhaling and when those two chemicals are mixed together , it has a 100 % fatality rate. After next Monday when I grab something to eat and a beer then I'll go to a place in the hills or somewhere where I won't be stopped and complete the method. Soon I'm going to be asleep and forever away from human suffering and be free if any issues for eternity ‚ù§Ô∏è
