Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I graduated college this year and thought for sure by now id at least have a start date for a new career. in fact, my temp job laid me off and before then they were cutting my hours. So now im unemployed and have no hopes or a job atm. I have job offers in other states but without funds to get there what good does that do? For the first time in awhile the suicidal thoughts have resurfaced. Anyway, i just wanted to get that out.
