True Label:	Yes
Post:
  There isn't anything i like about myself. I hate my skin color, i hate my body, i hate how i cant lose weight, i hate how anti-social i am, i hate how dumb i am, i hate my anxiety, i hate how i can make other people laugh but not myself, i hate how lonely i am. There isn't a damn thing i like about myself. Its like when i was being created, i was given all the bad things in life. I just want a new life.
