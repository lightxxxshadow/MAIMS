Yes
The post contains several indicators of thwarted belongingness. The individual expresses feelings of loneliness, feeling like a failure, and not having supportive friends or people to turn to in times of need. They also mention feeling disconnected from others, feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and rarely interacting with people who care about them. These experiences suggest a lack of belonging and social connection, which aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
