Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I do. Every time I look back on my past and even in my present I try to justify my shitty behavior because I keep thinking that maybe I'm just a good person on the inside. I treat my family and friends like shit and get angry at them for things that are mostly my fault. I feel like I'm not the person I thought I was.

The poster expresses feelings of guilt and self-blame for the way they treat their family and friends. They describe justifying their behavior as a way to believe they are a good person on the inside. This implies a low self-esteem and a sense of being burdened by their own actions.
