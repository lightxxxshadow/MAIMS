Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids? I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future.

No
The poster's question revolves around their desire to have kids in the future. They express their current lack of interest in having children but are open to the possibility of changing their mind in the distant future. This does not suggest depression but rather a reflection on personal preferences and the natural uncertainty that accompanies decisions about family planning.

Correct
Maintain caution against over-interpreting posts without clear evidence of mental health issues, and continue distinguishing between personal reflections and mental health conditions.
