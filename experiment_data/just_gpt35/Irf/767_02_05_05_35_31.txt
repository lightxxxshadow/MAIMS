Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Maybe because all I feel like I am is a toy. A useless one, at that. I wonder how he puts up with me. Use and throw away. Stupid. Boring. Unattractive. Terrible in bed. All I'm good for is for getting other people off and not myself. For spoiling others, because I don't want the burden of possessions for when I finally off myself. I had a nice thought earlier. Sell off all my things. Work up a travel fund. Travel to a nice place to disappear and die, probably. Somewhere that hopefully nobody I know has to deal with it. There's some things up in the air leaving me feeling uncertain, even though I was told they would help me. But I can't help but feel gross, or a burden for asking for financial assistance. I never wanted people to spend money on me. I can't wait until I can go back to living alone, where I don't have to eat. I am so sick of existing. I don't even really have much of a sex drive anymore. My libido's gone straight through the floor. I still crave being touched, but at the same time I feel like it would instigate a fight if he tried. Love him to death, but I can't shake that feeling that he only stays because I'm a clingy piece of shit.
