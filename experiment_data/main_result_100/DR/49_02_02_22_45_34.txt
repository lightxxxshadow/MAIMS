Yes
The poster's answers indicate several symptoms of depression, including feeling sad much of the time, feeling discouraged about the future, not enjoying things as much as before, restlessness or agitation, difficulty making decisions, feeling more worthless compared to others, having less energy, being more irritable than usual, difficulty concentrating, and experiencing fatigue more easily. These symptoms suggest a depressive disorder.

Correct
When assessing for depression, ensure you are not influenced by any biases or assumptions. Focus on the specific symptoms reported, as you did correctly here. However, remember that definitive diagnoses can't be made solely on a self-reported questionnaire and additional clinical evaluation is necessary. Avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information and remain objective in your assessment.
