Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hey guys! I‚Äôm new here, and I have been hesitant to speak on this. My depression started around 3 years ago during my sophomore year in high school, and I‚Äôve tried to suppress it as much as possible, but unfortunately it still plagues me in small instances while being in my second semester of college. One of them that I can‚Äôt seem to shake, is not being interested in literally anything. I used to love video games, now I can‚Äôt play one for 5 minutes without getting bored or annoyed. I used to love skateboarding, and now I can‚Äôt stand to go out and do it. Can anyone give me tips or solutions?

The poster mentions experiencing symptoms of depression and a lack of interest and enjoyment in activities they used to enjoy. This could indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a component of certain mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.
