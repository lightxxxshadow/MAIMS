Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I hate being undesirable. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Hopefully with this new haircut I could not look as untouchable. Especially since no one has liked me, I feel so pathetic in a way. I‚Äôm just ranting. I was sitting and thinking how bad I feel about my appearance and how much I try to be better. I got slimmer, got more muscle, haircut and all. All around, it‚Äôs a nightmare. It‚Äôs late and all I think about these hours are either suicide or imagining I am someone else. When I can, I fantasize about how my day would be different if I was a new man. I would look better, have friends, a girlfriend, a full loving and able-bodied family, nice house, etc. I guess it‚Äôs just the land of dreams for me until I die.

The post indicates feelings of low self-worth, self-hatred, and a desire to escape from one's current identity. The mention of suicide and fantasizing about being someone else could be indicative of a perceived burdensomeness, where the person feels like a burden to others and believes that their life would be better if they were someone else.
