Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  How do I get over a friendship? Hi all, I have gotten over people in the past... but having trouble here. The problem is that they treat all their other friends so good - but not me. So, it just hurts even more to get over this (I am the one ending the friendship because of how they treat me). I think I could get over it, if they were just a jerk or a bad friend - but they're not. They're just a bad friend to me. Any advice would be so helpful just to read and know maybe I'm not alone with the kind of pain.
