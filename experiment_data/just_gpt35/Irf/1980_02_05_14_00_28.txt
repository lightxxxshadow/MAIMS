Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  The last few I've seen were well-meaning but unfortunately it didn't work out. I feel worthless every day, I have no close friends, it really sucks. Countless social rejections have led me to believe that I am fundamentally broken, that no one wants to be my friend. I don't think that going to therapy will suddenly make me a really likable person that tons of people want to be friends with. But maybe it can make me feel better about myself. Because I can't go on living like this. I'm afraid I might try to kill myself or something.
