  My struggle I barely get out of bed, I lost my job because I got to depressed to go in, My family don’t speak to me because they don’t believe in how depressed I am, I’ve distanced myself from all my friends they don’t even check up on me anymore.

Yes
The poster mentions feeling depressed, experiencing loss of motivation (struggling to get out of bed), losing their job due to depression, lack of support from family and friends, and feeling forgotten and hurt. These are common symptoms and experiences associated with depression.

Correct
Ensure to always differentiate between the presentation of symptoms and an official diagnosis. While the poster describes symptoms that align with depression, be careful not to diagnose but rather suggest that they may be experiencing symptoms indicative of depression. Continue to use direct information from the posts to support your response to the mental health question without over-inference.
