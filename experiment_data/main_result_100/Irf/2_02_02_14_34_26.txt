Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Im afraid. The suicide scale is true. Its gets progressively worse and you dont even realize it. I was at 1 contemplating death and that was it. Now as i live i keep moving farther into the scale. Not existing is all i long for. Its all i think about. Its all i desire. Ive written 2 goodbye notes. I constantly open up the lid of pills and acting as if ill swallow them. Yesterday and today i have been making nooses with a thin belt and putting it around my neck. I squeeze so hard to simulate what its like. When i do i can feel the pressure in the top sides of my head. I can feel the rush and fear. I stopped giving a shit about everything and my attention is mainly death. Someone please comfort me. I am afraid.

Yes
The post shows risk of thwarted belongingness because the poster expresses feelings of being disconnected from others, feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and having limited interaction with people who care about them. They also mention that they rarely have satisfying interactions and feel that there are no people they can turn to in times of need. These feelings of isolation and lack of social support are indicative of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for mental health problems such as suicidal ideation.

Correct
Continue to thoroughly interpret the information from both the social media post and the responses to the mental health scale questions, ensuring your conclusions are directly supported by the evidence provided. Avoid making assumptions beyond what is explicitly expressed by the individual and maintain this level of careful analysis in future assessments.
