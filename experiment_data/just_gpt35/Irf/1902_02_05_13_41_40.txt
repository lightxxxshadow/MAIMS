Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  i was perfectly fine until about 9pm last night (i randomly started crying out of nowhere as i was watching a perfectly normal youtube video, although i've forgotten what it was about, but it wasn't anything upsetting or triggering). so i go to sleep at about 10ish and assume that i'll be better when i wake up, but i was wrong. i woke up still depressed and crying again, not wanting to get out of bed or do anything, let alone go to uni and do my work/study. i get up and get ready (although this felt like it took an eternity to do), and go to uni for a while, but i found it really overwhelming. i don't remember what else happened, but i decided to go back home (student flat) and try to take my mind off work even though i can't because the deadlines are coming pretty fast. to think that i was full of energy and ideas 2 days ago is beyond me since i've barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning. i also don't have the energy to cry anymore, so now i'm just empty and wanting to die. also this post doesn't really make much sense, but i'm super depressed and empty that i feel like i can't function anymore
