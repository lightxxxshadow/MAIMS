Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life. Has anyone else felt that way? I've been to my psychiatrist and adjusted my meds and know I'm doing great. I just thought I'd share incase someone can relate.

The post suggests that the individual finds comfort in the thought that their loved ones would be impacted by their suicide. This indicates a sense of being a burden on others, which is a key component of perceived burdensomeness in mental health.
