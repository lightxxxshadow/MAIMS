Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So I finally realized something this week... Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void. I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.
