Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Please ignore my grammatical errors And thank you if you are reading this So the thing is I am trying so hard to be happy and ignore the toxic people in life but the thing is I don't have friends, not a girlfriend. This is eating me inside making me awkward around people which gives the weird vibe around people. I am anxious around people which make me a different human which make more difficult to make friends. There were some people in my life which I thought would stay around me so I ignored toxicity and thought it will become better but it backfired me because when I tried to talk to them about what they have done to me they turned the table around me and blamed me for all. Now I don't know how to make myself innocent and they have played with my emotions and I want to prove myself and want pay for there deeds I am trying so hard to don't give a f*ck but overthinking is killing me and I am losing all my self-confidence and self-respect.
