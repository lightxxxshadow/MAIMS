Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No

  I'm not sure if this is the right sub Reddit to place this question but I was wondering if anyone else that deals with depression also believes people are capable of reading your own thoughts. I've also started listening in to people's conversations because I think they're all talking about me. Is this common for people that suffer with depression? Anyone else deal with this?

The post describes symptoms of paranoia, which could be indicative of a mental health issue, but it does not specifically mention feelings of perceived burdensomeness.
