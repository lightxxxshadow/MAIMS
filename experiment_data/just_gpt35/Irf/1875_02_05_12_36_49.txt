  I'll probably do it in my middle age. I don't want to die old and helpless. For now, I'll push on and I'll do my best for others even if it means dying.

The post suggests that the person is willing to sacrifice themselves for others even if it means dying. This indicates a perception of burdensomeness, as they feel like they are a burden to others and believe that their death would be less burdensome to those around them.
