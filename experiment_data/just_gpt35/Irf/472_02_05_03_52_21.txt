Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've been going through a rough patch. I was recently diagnosed with mild depression and GAD and have worry reduction group therapy in a few weeks. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk or turn to without feeling guilty or like I am making a meal out of how i'm feeling. I try and help people who have more stressful things going on as a distraction technique but I am now feeling like I should just stop messaging or contacting people because at least then, I wont feel guilty about bothering someone. I have tried monitoring sleep but that has stopped and I am sleeping less. I tried a mood diary app on my phone but that last about a month. I also tried coming off facebook for a few weeks, but didn't notice much difference. I'm at a bit of a stand still with regards of what to do. I'm not too sure what to expect from writing this or if i'll get anything out of it. But i think the anonymity of it helps a little.
