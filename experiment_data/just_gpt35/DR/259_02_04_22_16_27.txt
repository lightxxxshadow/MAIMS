Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Even if someone says something nice to me, I can't bring myself to believe it was genuine. I can't wrap my head around the idea of someone actually believing anything positive about me. To me they must be doing it out of pity. Depression is like a filter. Any incoming stimulus is just turned into something negative.
