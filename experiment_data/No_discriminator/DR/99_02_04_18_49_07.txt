Yes
The post indicates feelings of isolation and a lack of support from others. The poster mentioned that their friends and family are too busy to be there for them, and they expressed a strong desire for a hug and hoped for a better tomorrow. Additionally, the poster's answers to the mental scale questions suggest a sense of disconnection from others, feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and a lack of satisfying interactions. These factors indicate a risk of experiencing thwarted belongingness, which refers to feeling socially disconnected and lacking a sense of belonging.
