Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  One think i wont ever understand is my friends getting extremly sad when i mention that i want to kill myself. They always somehow manage to talk me out of it but i dont u derstand why they would. My life's shit and i dont look forward to amything anymore. I really just want to die. Thats literally the only thing that would make me happy. Shouldnt they want the best for me? Why do they always keep me from being happy? And why does it work?

The post indicates a sense of isolation and a desire for connection with others. The individual expresses feeling misunderstood by their friends and questions why they prevent them from finding happiness through their desire to die. This suggests a possible experience of thwarted belongingness, where the person feels a lack of social support or connection.
