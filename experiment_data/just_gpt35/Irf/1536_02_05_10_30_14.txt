Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My dog is being fostered by a friend. Dog escaped. Friend called freaking out. I freaked out. Boyfriend freaked out and wanted to drive to get dog. I said no because he‚Äôs been drinking. LOST HIS SHIT. Tried to talk to him, pushed for it despite his attempts to distance himself. I‚Äôve been pushed, smacked wth a shoe, dumped, called all kinds of names in the book.. there are holes in my walls, my belongings are smashed and destroyed.. we literally just talked about our future together 4 hours ago... then bam.. I‚Äôm a stupid cunt piece of shit bitch. It 4.5 hours in to 2018 and I‚Äôm praying I dont wake up. It‚Äôs all my fault I should have just left him alone.. nothing I ever do is right. Ever. Our bed feels empty. I can‚Äôt stop shaking. I want to vomit everywhere. I love him, more than I‚Äôve ever loved anything, and I would forgive him in a heartbeat..
