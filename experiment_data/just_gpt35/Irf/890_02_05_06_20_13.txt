  She's happier after she broke up with me, I feel like its my fault i lost her it probably was, bipolar disorder OCD and anxiety just get to be to much for me and i either say things i don't mean or make dumb jokes. I honestly feel like i could never love anyone else but i'm just glad she's happy now.
