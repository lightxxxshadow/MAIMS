Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Been suicidal for a few years and today im done. Ive been bullied since grade 1, my father used to bias me when i was young, i was lied too by damn near everyone, lost my mom in 2018, attempted on multiple ocasions, nobody ever fucking listens to me, and im finally past my tipping point. I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life. EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all. I also have medication im going to down before i start to...attempt fully. If I live, I may (cant guarantee) re edit this post. Don't feel bad for me, I've wanted this. I ACTIVELY want this. So, thank you for taking the time to read this (though I doubt itll ever be seen) and goodbye.
