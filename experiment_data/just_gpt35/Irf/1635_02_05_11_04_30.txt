Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My brothers build computer for a living, my sister is great at coding, my cousins are engineers, and I can barely get a mini drone to work. The only things I can do is play games, D&amp;D (not as good as my siblings, might I add), and debate religion/ethics, all three of which are taken up completely on youtube so I wouldn't even get seen by anyone, and both were hit by adpocalypse so even if I were to get popular I would be demonetized instantly.

The post expresses feelings of inadequacy and a sense of being overshadowed by the poster's siblings and cousins who are skilled in computer-related fields. This can potentially lead to a perception of burdensomeness, as the poster may feel that they lack valuable skills or contributions compared to their family members.
