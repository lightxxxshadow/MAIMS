True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Help.. So, I have a friend, who's had quite a tough life.(prefer not to go into details) I've always had severe anxiety issues, mostly social Such was the cause for major bullying. This, combined with family issues, put me into a deep depression, bringing me to contemplate suicide. All of this was before I knew this friend. I brought this up to him the other day, and he replied with  all the shit ive been through in my life and im STILL GOING THROUGH and you you think about suicide because of your social awkwardness?  He now has me blocked on all social media, and I'm not exactly sure how to go about this.
