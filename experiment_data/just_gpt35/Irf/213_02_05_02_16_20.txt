Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout. Does anyone currently take viibryd? Have you even come off of it, what was it like? I heard the withdrawals are horrible.

The post does not show any explicit signs of perceived burdensomeness. The poster is primarily concerned about the negative side effects of their medication, such as weight gain, increased anxiety, and cost, and the impact these have on their well-being. They express fear of discontinuing medication due to the potential worsening of depression, but there is no direct indication of feeling burdensome to others in the post.
