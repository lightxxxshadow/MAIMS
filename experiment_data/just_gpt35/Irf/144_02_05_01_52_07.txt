Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have no job, no friends and no girlfriend. All I do is play video games, hang with my dog and workout for an hour. I‚Äôm so bored with life. Worse part is I don‚Äôt wanna do anything. I don‚Äôt wanna socialize, don‚Äôt wanna go out, nothing really feels worthwhile and genuinely interesting. I‚Äôm almost 30 and life has lost all purpose. All I wait for is my next hour at the gym everyday.
