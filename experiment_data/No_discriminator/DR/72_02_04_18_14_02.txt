Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  How do you decide to live for yourself? I can't do anything for myself. I don't mean I can't dress myself or shower etc, I mean I don't care to progress my career, I don't care to try and be a better person and all that. I'm finding that I'm putting off whatever I want to do (study for career progression, do martial arts, try harder with photography etc), in place of  being support  for my girlfriend. Emotional or otherwise. I put her above me, so I don't do anything. This is wrong, because it leaves me bitter with myself and my choices, because I want to be better for her etc. But wtf do I do? How do I do it?
