Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have been trying to have a baby for the last 4 years and after several miscarriages, and late periods here I am empty handed. There is this huge void in my heart and It has been horrible this past holiday season. I usually can shut out the baby stuff but everyone on social media is having a baby. My heart yearns more everyday and it isn't any closer to happening. Every single month I'm so disappointed in myself and my body. Aunt flo comes without fail...oh would you look at that..
