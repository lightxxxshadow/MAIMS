Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm past sadness I just feel empty or hollow. I go through the motions of life everyday but I‚Äôm not present . I‚Äôm supposed to be getting better but I‚Äôm becoming something much worse and I live in my head all the time. I can‚Äôt care about anyone anymore and I certainly don‚Äôt care about myself. I‚Äôm only still alive because I know my family wouldn‚Äôt take it well and it would be selfish of me to put this pain on them. I just dont see the point in trying anymore
