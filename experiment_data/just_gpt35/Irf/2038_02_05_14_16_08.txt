Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel so low and depressed between everything. I just feel worthless and just can't cope with anything no more. I have lost interest in life and everything else. Doing anything just tires me now. I get moments where the littlest thing pushes me over the edge and I end up smashing things or punching doors only to burst out crying on the floor and I just can't stop it. I want to cry a lot but I seem to get moments like this. I don't understand it. I just want to be left alone by everything and want to just crawl up in a ball and cry all the time. Has anyone had an experience of this? I feel so bad though. My Mum is putting up with a lot with me and doesn't deserve the shouting, smashing and me crying all the time. She deserves better than the way I am treating her.
