Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I just feel like nothing I ever do is enough. I work hard and try to do my best but it never seems to be enough. My job is great except for the people in the office. I came into work today and received a disciplinary meeting in two weeks. I have not done anything out of the ordinary or wrong and my boss literally said to me last week ‚Äú all your hard work isn‚Äôt going unnoticed!‚Äù. So this laughable disciplinary is a slap in the face. Unless my boss meant that they think I suck? This is exactly a year since the last time I was called in and interrogated/ yelled at for nothing. I‚Äôm not sure if this is their need to assert dominance on workers that actually do their jobs so that they don‚Äôt move up/think they came move up. I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of it. My mother is dying, my brother is in jail with schizophrenia and I have no significant other. I‚Äôve been working towards getting into a nursing program and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do if I don‚Äôt get in. I‚Äôve quit drinking but suicidal thoughts sober are... sobering lol. I just feel like life is a joke.
