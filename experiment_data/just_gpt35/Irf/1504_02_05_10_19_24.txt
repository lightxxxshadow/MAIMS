Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I usually lurk for awhile, but this feels safe enough. Truth is, I‚Äôve know for decades that I lost the Genetic Brain Chemistry Lottery. In other words, I‚Äôve been self-medicating nightly for 3 or 4 decades, a moderate to heavy drinker. Odd situations: I worked in a field that drug tested me every 3 months, performed a polygraph every year, and would pull you clearance if they found out you were on anti-psychotics because you were a security risk. But it was fine to keep a bottle in your desk. They finally experienced ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù a couple of years back, but old habits die hard for us old hands. So, after six months of getting the brain chemistry stable (a lot of trial and error in that business). The snakes have been on me long enough. Time to take the depression and anxiety seriously.
