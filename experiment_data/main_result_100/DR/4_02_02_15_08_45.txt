Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids? I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future.

No
Based on the answers to the mental scale questions, the poster does not report any symptoms typically associated with depression. There are no indications of sadness, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-accusations, suicidal thoughts, crying, agitation, worthlessness, loss of energy, changes in sleeping pattern, irritability, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, or changes in interest in sex. Therefore, it is unlikely that the poster is suffering from depression.
