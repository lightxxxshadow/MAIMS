Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My friends fall out with the rest of the group as we don’t agree with them on genders. I’m just going to get straight to the point, I have these two friends ( I’ll call them Ava and Chloe) who fall out with me and the rest of my friends as they believe there’s more that two genders and the rest of us don’t believe that (I’m not saying they can’t believe that but I’m just saying the way that they act when we say we don’t is bad). They usually talk to us the day after and act like nothing happened, but it bothers me. So here’s a summary of what happens. Someone brings up the topic of genders, and then will say how they think there’s two, then either Ava or chole will get mad and will storm of or start shouting at us. Ava once called my boyfriend a “close minded cunt” simply because he said he didn’t agree with her. If they believe that there’s more than two genders, I am totally ok with that, it’s just that they try and make the rest of us believe it too and then put the blame onto us and it’s starting to bug me. So if anyone knows what I can do about this, I’d be really glad if you could help me out. Thank you for reading :)
