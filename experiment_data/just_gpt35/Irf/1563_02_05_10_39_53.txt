Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have never felt so bad, I'm feeling like going to the bathroom and poisoning myself instantly since I'm finally brave enough to kill myself. I have no one, Fucked up my future, disappointed my parents and family (many times), I'm useless and all I do is, is to waste space. Got no one to talk to except some good internet friends, I might finally kms now.
