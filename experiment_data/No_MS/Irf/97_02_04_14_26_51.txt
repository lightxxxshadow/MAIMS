Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hi all, I have been struggling with the idea of being too greedy. I mean: I have people who love me (family, friends, partners, pets), I have a job with an acceptable salary, I have hobbies. Lately I haven't been feeling competent, but I know I am good in my job, and also that I am a good, nice, kind person who cares about others. So, what do I have to complain about? Why am I not satisfied? Why do I want more? Meh.

No
The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness. The poster is questioning their own feelings of dissatisfaction and wanting more, but there is no indication of feeling burdensome to others or feeling like a burden themselves.

Correct
Continue to differentiate between self-reflection and perceived burdensomeness. Pay attention to the content of the post and avoid over-inference without supporting evidence.
