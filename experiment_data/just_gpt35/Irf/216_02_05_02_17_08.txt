Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  ...And each day hurts. Sometimes I am angry as hell at her for leaving me for the boyfriend who originally dumped her; some days all I want is for her to come back (I know, I know-- it won't happen, get over it, blah blah blah; that doesn't mean the wishing goes away). It feels like she was my last chance at happiness, and that I am doomed to be alone forever. I do not want this pain. :-(
