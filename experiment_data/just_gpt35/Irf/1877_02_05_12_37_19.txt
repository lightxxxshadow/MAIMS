Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Before I start I do got to say that I do not struggle with girls becoming interested in me since most of RateMe and many other places rate me at about 7.5-8 out of 10 for a male which is about average. My main problem is keeping their interest in me. A little background on me, I don't have many hobbies,dropped out of HS because of social anxiety and deppression,fathers dead,still living with mother, have no car nor license,and have no motivation whatsoever. So my life's a mess. So compared to most my age I'm lacking in pretty much everything, especially confidence. No friends really, so I'm mostly alone and feel like dying. Thats why I came here, I need advice and need it bad because soon I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself because this pain keeps breaking me down and down and I don't know where to turn. So any help would be appreciated. I'm just so close to ending it I just need someone to talk to right now.
