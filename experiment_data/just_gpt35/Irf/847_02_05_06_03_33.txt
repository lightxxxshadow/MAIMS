Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My best friend is gone. She hasn't responded in days. I haven't been able to talk to anyone else. I feel so alone. I want to say my goodbyes to everyone at some point next week. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't tell my parents about this because they usually ask me if I have a girlfriend, as a joke/nice gesture.

The post suggests feelings of loneliness, isolation, and a desire to say goodbyes. These sentiments indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual may perceive themselves as a burden on others and contemplate suicide as a way to relieve that burden.
