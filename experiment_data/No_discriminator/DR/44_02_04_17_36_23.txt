Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond. My emotions have become so numb that I can't feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There's nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I don't know what else to say. It's the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I don't even look forward to coming home from work because it's not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It's all the same dullness. I'd probably work 12-14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it wouldn't bother me at all, I'm not missing out on anything. Too bad they don't because they don't want to pay overtime for me of course.
