Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I was diagnosed with borderline disability and it's making me suicidal and homicidal. I've never accomplished anything in my life I have no ged, no job, no licence all I want to do is get a ged so I can go to college to study a trade. Why do people with learning disability have to take the same test as people who don't have learning disability of course it would be easier for them but for us the test feels like a foreign language to me. Also I'm going to be homeless because of me nobody else fault my parents want me to stay but if they die I will be homeless anyways.

The post indicates a sense of isolation and lack of belonging, as the poster discusses feeling alone and potentially being homeless. This suggests a risk of thwarted belongingness, which can contribute to feelings of desperation and increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
