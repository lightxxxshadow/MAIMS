  My younger brother is cooler than me Hi! So I have a bit of an embarassing truth to admit. I believe my younger brother is way cooler than me. I've never been one of the most popular people in any given situation, but I have a few close friends so it's not too bad. My brother however is one of those people that can walk into a room and immediately own it. Where my clothing style is a bit uninteresting, his is eye-catching. While I'm fairly quiet and not particularily funny, he is confident and charismatic. I get invited to parties every now and then, but he gets invited to parties every week. Oh and it doesn't help that he is taller than me nowadays. He is not better than me at everything thankfully. For instance I'm an organised person and my grades are far above average, while his grades are far below. The point is that I'm not a cool person by any stretch but he is very popular and respected. It's silly I know, but it does hurt my pride a bit seeing as I'm older than him, and you usually expect the older sibling to have the high ground in this respect. Am I alone in this? Anyone else who have experienced something similar? :P

The poster expresses feelings of inadequacy and inferiority compared to their younger brother, but they do not exhibit symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as persistent sadness, loss of interest, or changes in sleep and appetite. The feelings of pride being hurt and the desire to be seen as cool are more indicative of low self-esteem and sibling comparison rather than depression.
