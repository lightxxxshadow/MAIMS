Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  No friend left behind? *short* I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least). Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship. Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her. I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way. I feel like if they didn’t want to be friends anymore they should say something to her to give her a fair chance. Am I overthinking this or on track?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

No
The poster's concern seems to be related to their friends' behavior and loyalty rather than exhibiting symptoms of depression.

Correct
Great job in avoiding the common mistake of over-inference. You have stayed focused on the given information without assuming characteristics that the poster has not displayed. Always remember to assess only the information presented in the post and refrain from assuming mental health conditions like depression without clear indicators.
