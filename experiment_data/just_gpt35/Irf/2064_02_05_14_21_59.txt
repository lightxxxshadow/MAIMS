Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My sadness has been dragging me for weeks and today, I'm too lazy to do the things I normally do. Even the things that I want to do. I wasn't able to go to school today because it was really hard to get out of my bed. I'm not even in the mood to play games. Every minor thing that bums me out affects me drastically. I haven't tried going to the hospital regarding my mental health and I am not sure if this is all just in my head or I really have depression.
