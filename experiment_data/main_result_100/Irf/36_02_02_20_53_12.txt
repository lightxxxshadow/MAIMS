Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's answers to the mental scale questions indicate a sense of being disconnected from others, feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and rarely interacting with people who care about them. Additionally, they mentioned being away from their fiancé and family, feeling like they have no friends, and feeling like they have no point in continuing. These factors suggest a heightened risk of thwarted belongingness, as they are experiencing a lack of social connection and support.

Correct
Continue to carefully assess the individual's statements and the responses to the mental health scale questions, ensuring you pull information from both to justify your conclusions regarding their mental health status. Be mindful not to infer aspects that are not supported by the evidence provided.
