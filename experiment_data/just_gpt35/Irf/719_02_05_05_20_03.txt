True Label:	No
Post:
  My grades have plummeted, I‚Äôve antagonized my friends, I‚Äôve cut ties with my crush, I‚Äôve hurt my mother to the point where she won‚Äôt talk to me, and I‚Äôve disappointed myself. There is no other reason holding me back from the other side. I‚Äôm sorry to everyone who tried to help in the end. You were only delaying the inevitable. See you next time around!

The poster mentions cutting ties with their crush, hurting their mother to the point where she won't talk to them, and feeling like there is nothing holding them back from the other side. These statements indicate a perceived burdensomeness and a feeling of being responsible for negative outcomes in relationships.
