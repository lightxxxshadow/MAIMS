The post indicates feelings of loneliness, disappointment, and anger towards the poster's mother. The poster expresses a desire to forget everyone in their life and even mentions wanting to be hit in the head to achieve this. These statements suggest a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the poster may feel like a burden to others and believe that their absence may alleviate the burden they feel they impose on others.
