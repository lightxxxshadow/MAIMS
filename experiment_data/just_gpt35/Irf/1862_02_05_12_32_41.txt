True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So I'm 99% sure I'm struggling with depression and have been for the past 2 weeks. Every time I try and talk to friends about it, they just pass me on to helplines and such. I've done it once. But it just takes too long to explain my fkn life story and why I'm fucked up. Am I doing it wrong? What should i even be saying? Like I don't really think there's any point in it
