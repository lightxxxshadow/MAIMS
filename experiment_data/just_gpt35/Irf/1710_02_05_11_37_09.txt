Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My closest friends have been distant lately. Mostly busy with their jobs, other friends, or partners. I feel they don't really care about me as they're hard to get in contact with. If I gave in to my depression, would they even care that I'm dead?

The post suggests that the person is feeling distant and disconnected from their closest friends, which can indicate a sense of thwarted belongingness. They express feeling like their friends don't care about them and question if anyone would care if they were no longer alive. These thoughts reflect a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, a psychological factor associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation.
