Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates feelings of isolation, lack of support, and a desire for a hug. The poster states that nobody can be there for them and feels like a burden. These thoughts and emotions suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual believes that they are a burden on others and that others would be happier without them.

Incorrect
Be wary of making inferences that are not substantiated by the provided data. Although the post expresses feelings of loneliness and the desire for support, these do not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness. The answers to the relevant mental health scale suggest that the poster does not view themselves as a burden; they denied having issues with most questions related to burdensomeness. Focus on direct evidence from the responses rather than inferring beyond what is stated. Cross-reference the social media post with the scale answers to avoid incorrect assumptions about the poster's perception of burdensomeness.

ITER 1
No
The post expresses feelings of loneliness and a desire for support, but the answers to the relevant mental health scale suggest that the poster does not view themselves as a burden. They denied having issues with most questions related to burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Review the answered questions for themes of disconnection and feelings of not belonging, as these might suggest perceived burdensomeness. Ensure that your interpretation aligns with the patient's self-reported perceptions and statements rather than inferring without evidence.

ITER 2
Yes
The poster's responses to questions 6, 7, 9, 11, and 13 indicate a sense of disconnection, feeling like an outsider, and lack of people to turn to in times of need. These feelings suggest a perceived burdensomeness, as the poster feels that they do not have supportive and caring relationships or interactions with others.

Correct
Good analysis linking the poster's sense of disconnection and lack of support to perceived burdensomeness. Ensure to also consider other questions that might not explicitly confirm this but provide context to the overall mental state.
