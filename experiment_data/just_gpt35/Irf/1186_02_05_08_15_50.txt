Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I went to therapy for a few sessions and the book  Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy  was required reading. The book highlights unhealthy thinking patterns and trains you in how to spot them. I've found that All or Nothing thinking is a root to much of my hopelessness and causes self fulfilling prophecies. For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself. I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use. Bottom line, if you can't afford therapy, try it out.

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. The poster discusses the impact of unhealthy thinking patterns and the positive effects of therapy and a self-help book, but there is no indication of feeling excluded or isolated from social interactions or relationships.
