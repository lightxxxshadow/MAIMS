Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I cannot name a single good thing about myself-I am not smart, not charismatic, not good looking, not a good person, not got social skills, got no talents or skills, I am bad at everything I've ever tried in my life. I have 1700 hours in CS:GO and I'm worse than people with half my hours, I played (association) football my whole life and I was always trash at that, I tried to do guitar for a few years when I was younger but I got kicked out because the teacher thought I wasn't practising-I was, I just was really bad at it. I have a few friends but they don't like me that much and I don't blame them because I'm a bad person to be friends with, I am boring, I have no distinct interests and I can't hold a conversation for more than 5 seconds. I just don't understand why I should like myself, if anything it'd be irrational not to hate myself because every single aspect of my life is going terribly and it's ultimately no-one's fault but my own.
