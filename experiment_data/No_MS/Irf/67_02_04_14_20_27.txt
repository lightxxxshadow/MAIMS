Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hello. I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much. I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand. To summarize for you all: * They were involved in some deep stuff. * Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head. * The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. &gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed. * They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment. * Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly. I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them. What can I do?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates that the individual is expressing concern and empathy for their friend who is going through a difficult time. The poster mentions that the friend's life is crumbling and they are experiencing mental illnesses, including PTSD, violent seizures, and traumatizing flashbacks. The friend has also faced rejection from doctors and other friends. This suggests that the friend may perceive themselves as a burden to others, which is a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Ensure that the individual being referred to in the question is the same as the one being discussed in the post. The question asks about the risk of perceived burdensomeness in the poster, not their friend. Focus on the information given about the poster and avoid making inferences about the friend's feelings when the question is specifically about the poster.

ITER 1
No
The post does not provide enough information to determine the risk of perceived burdensomeness in the poster. The focus of the post is on the friend who is experiencing mental health difficulties, and the poster is seeking advice on how to support them. The poster's own feelings and experiences are not explicitly mentioned, so it is difficult to assess the risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
Continue to differentiate between the mental health of the poster and the person they are describing. Be cautious not to infer or project issues onto the poster that are not supported by evidence within the post.
