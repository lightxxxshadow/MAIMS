Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Recently, im going through a severe depressive episode and I did some things I would not have otherwise done that are now affecting my mental health further and affecting someone I love. I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes. It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode. Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic). The four abilities: Understanding Appreciating Reasoning Ability to express a choice Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment. It is not consistent enough for me to able to say I possess any of them during these times. Thank you for reading ‚ô°

The post suggests that the poster is experiencing a severe depressive episode and feels that their actions during this time are negatively affecting someone they love. They also express a concern about society's perception of responsibility and decision-making during such episodes. This indicates a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may feel that their depressive state burdens others and impacts their ability to make sound decisions.
