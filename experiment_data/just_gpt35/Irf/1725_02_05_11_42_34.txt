Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  The past two years have taught me never to hope. Hope is a very big mistake to be making. Every single time I have hoped for the best, or looked forward to the future, it has been taken away without any real reasons and denied. This is not me. I used to love waking up in the morning and I used to love going to school, going home, going to bed. I loved EVERYTHING because I was looking forward to everything. Now what? Days are a fucking blur and all I'm thinking about is the next time I'll be suffering, whether it be dealing with terrible bosses at an underpaid, over stressful job, dealing with angry people, or worrying about not doing the shit I should be. I used to be on top of my shit, and now I feel like I am helplessly behind. I want to hope, but I will hate to see myself be wrong again. I want to hope this year will be better, but I remember making that same promise last year for 2016. It was not better, just same shit different year. I don't really want to hate my life, but I can't help it. I don't think I'll be able to save myself, but I don't know who even could. Thanks for reading my thoughts, just looking for opinions about this, or even confirmations of someone reading it.
