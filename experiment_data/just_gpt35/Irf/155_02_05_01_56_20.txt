Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I told my parents I loved them and that I was sorry. I told them its not their fault Im just tired of waking up and feeling like I‚Äôm in fight or flight every day all day. I told my girlfriend she should move on and find someone better who actually deserves her love. I told my friends thank you for being there sometimes but Im done fighting. I‚Äôve lost the battle. Tomorrow is my last sunrise. Tomorrow night I‚Äôm out of here. Good bye all.
