Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôve sat in a dark room for 5 hours staring at a wall, doing nothing. Yet I still felt as bored as if I were to just watch Netflix or play games. I feel bored and scared. Scared that I lost my mind and will never be normal again.
