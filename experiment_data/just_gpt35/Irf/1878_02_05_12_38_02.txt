Post:
  I met this girl month ago and i feel in love very quick. She is from Portugal and i am from Slovenia.. And we thought about having a long distance but she feels like its not gonna work. We talked about it 2 days ago and i told her i cant be there just friends because im only making myself suffer, she seems to have no problem with it, but i just cant get over myself and watching somebody drift away while i wait. It hurts so much and the things she said about me how amazing i am and how bad she wants me to stay there, but i just cant im falling into depression again. I told her im gonna stay but i dont know if im capable im just hurting myself. 3 years of this and just when you think you get out of it it crawls back so fast ahhhhh. And i feel like the most egoistical, needy piece of shit that i cant get over the fact its over. Fuck this shit and fuck life. Thanks for listening ‚ù§Ô∏è

The individual expresses a sense of loneliness and despair, feeling unable to be just friends and experiencing intense emotional pain. They mention falling into depression and feeling like an egoistical, needy piece of shit. These feelings of rejection, isolation, and self-criticism suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness.
