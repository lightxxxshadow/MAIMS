Post:
  Want to cut but can’t I promised my girlfriend I wouldn’t self harm but last Friday I tried but I started panicking because I remembered what I said and she would see the cuts. I gave her my box cutter on Friday and today I started looking for something else in my room and I don’t have anything. I’m going to my schools counseling center with her today.

The poster's expression of wanting to self-harm, feeling the need to hide self-harm from their girlfriend, and seeking help from a counseling center suggest symptoms related to depression.
