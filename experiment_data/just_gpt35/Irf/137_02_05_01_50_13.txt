Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I thought there was a small chance that I might get invited to make plans by old friends, but I should have known that wasn't gonna happen due to persisting false rumors. Now I'm stuck in my room just sad and depressed. I am 21 though, so I'm wondering if I should just go to the bar and drink a bit so at least I'm surrounded by people when the new year starts. I'm hopeful for the future, but rn I'm down as hell. I try to look my best all the time but my nerdy demeanor and social anxiety kills any interest someone might have towards me. Idk what to do.

The post suggests feelings of isolation, sadness, and low self-esteem due to not being included in social plans and persisting false rumors. The mention of wanting to go to a bar to be surrounded by people and the comment about a nerdy demeanor and social anxiety indicate a desire for social connection but also the belief that one's presence may not be valued or desired by others, which is a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness.
