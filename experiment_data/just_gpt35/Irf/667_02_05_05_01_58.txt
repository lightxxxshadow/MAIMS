Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Not sure how to start this. So ill start by telling a few things about my life. I am a 23 years old male, living in brazil, currently working with IT. My parents and my girlfriend are really supportive and i don't really have big problems in my life, which leads to the big issue: i feel like complete shit. Despite having a job, a car, a girlfriend, a place with people that i know that love me that i can call home, i still feel like complete shit and knowing these things and not understanding why i feel like this makes me feel even worse. I have tried suicide in the past and these thoughts are behind me, but the feeling of being worthless and that im not accomplishing anything haunt me everyday. I would appreciate some help on this. Thank you and Sorry for the rant.

The poster expresses feelings of worthlessness, not feeling accomplished, and having thoughts of suicide in the past. These symptoms indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual perceives themselves as a burden on others and may feel that their existence is causing harm or distress to loved ones.
