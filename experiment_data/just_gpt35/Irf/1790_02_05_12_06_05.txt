Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Another day of nobody at home understanding the underlying reasons I do things . Why I sleep so much, why I'm in my room all the time, why I eat so much. I sleep so I don't have to deal with things. I'm in my room so I don't bother people. I eat so much because food is the one of the few things that make me happy anymore. I put on the facade for everyone that I'm this optimistic, happy go lucky person, but if people really knew. And God forbid I tell my mom I have depression. She'd yell and tell me I don't. I know somethings wrong. I have something, depression, BPD, ADHD, something! But I'm too poor to be diagnosed and too scared to ever confide in family, to only be told I'm saying this because I want attention. And every day I have to pretend I'm ok.
