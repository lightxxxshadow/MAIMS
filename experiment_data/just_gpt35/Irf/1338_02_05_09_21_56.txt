Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  It feels like a vicious cycle. Im not allowed to leave my room until my HW's done (with the exception of eating meals). And because I cant focus, I don't get my work done. So I stay in my room like 80% of the time. The inablity to do anything stresses me out and makes me depressed. And because Im depressed, I cant focus on my work. So the work just piles up and up while I sit in my room, unable to get anything done. I try and try to get my work done, and I know I can do it, *but it just doesnt happen*. It makes me feel like a big screwup compared to my sister, who when she was my age, almost always got grades above a B. I need to brake the cycle, but I dont know where. Ive tried taking medicine to help me focus, but it doesnt seem to work. My semester ends in 2 weeks and I dont know what to do.

The post indicates a lack of social connection and support, as the person feels isolated in their room and compares themselves negatively to their sister. This can be an indication of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for mental health problems.
