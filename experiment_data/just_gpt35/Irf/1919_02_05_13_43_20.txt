The post expresses feelings of being stuck, thinking the same negative thoughts, and getting nothing done, which suggests a sense of perceived burdensomeness. The repetitive questioning of why the person is still alive and feeling stuck indicates a potential risk of perceiving themselves as a burden to others.
