True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm 20 years old unemployed and just got an email saying I might not be able to stay in university next year. I have zero friends and speak to my family at most once a month. I haven‚Äôt been eating properly and have very little motivation to do anything. I‚Äôve tried many times to fix this but I‚Äôm ready to just end it.
