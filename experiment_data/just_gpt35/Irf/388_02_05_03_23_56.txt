Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  After many years of variety of meds for a variety of things (ADHD, depression, sleep, bipolar), I decided to self-medicate with coffee, melatonin, excercise, a therapy light, and running my own business rather than having to follow stupid rules. Actually, the self-medication thing worked pretty well. It probably helps that I've lived with a physician for many years. However, the business did not go well, and I'm back to being full-time employed for someone else. Basically, I'd need to make an appointment in St. Paul before work or after work, but I'd prefer weekends. I know this is not a TwinCities specific board, but with 160k readers, I figure there might be someone from around here.

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness as the individual does not express feelings of isolation or lack of connection with others. They mention living with a physician and seeking appointments, which suggests some support system is in place.
