Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I've been lying here for hours just doing nothing. I can't go out today because I'm having a chronic illness flare-up. But, I can't seem to find anything to interest me at home, either. All of my hobbies just seem dull. I don't know what to do any more.

The poster mentions feeling like they have nothing to do, finding their hobbies dull, and not knowing what to do anymore. These thoughts and feelings can indicate a sense of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual feels like they are a burden to others or feel useless and unproductive due to their chronic illness flare-up.
