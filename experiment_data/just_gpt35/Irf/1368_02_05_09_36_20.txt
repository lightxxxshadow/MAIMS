Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  That's all. I have no value, nothing to offer anyone, and everyone knows it. If I act exceptionally nice and let people use me I can get them to spend time with me sometimes. But no one actually gives the slightest fuck about me. There's no one to share in my successes, no one who's there for me when I'm extra sad, no one who cares about what I'm thinking, no one who even enjoys my company. I'm just worthless
