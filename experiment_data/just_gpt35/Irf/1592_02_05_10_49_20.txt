Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I thought my depression had lessened because i was feeling things again, but i have been sober for 2 months now and i think it was probably just the alcohol, because i don‚Äôt feel like i have been becoming a lot more numb lately, not being sad feels good at least but i think a lot of the happiness has gone with it, i feel so bored.
