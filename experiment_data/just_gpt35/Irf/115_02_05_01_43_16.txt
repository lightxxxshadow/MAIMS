Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It feels like every other moment is spent worrying or being depressed, sometimes without a direct reason at all. I'll just start feeling terrible for no reason. Sometimes I have to ask myself,  Why am I feeling this way? Am I actually in any kind of danger?  And the vast majority of the time the answer is no. I'm already on meds, and yet I'm still so bad.
