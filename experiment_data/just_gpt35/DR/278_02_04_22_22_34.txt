Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Should my friend pay for the damage she caused to my car? I asked my friend to drive my car and pick me and some of our other friends up from a party. She drove about 7 miles, 15 mins, with the parking brakes on. I took it to the shop the next day and they said I would be fine for now, but I would need to repair the damage within a month. They said it would be $250. If it was me I would've offered to pay 100% right away. Should I ask her to pay? Should I get her insurance involved? We're both college students and she doesn't have a job. I don't want to ruin the friendship, but I'm already super upset about the damage to my car and feel that she should take responsibility for this. What should I do??

The poster shows signs of frustration and upset over the damage to their car, but this does not necessarily indicate depression. Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, and other symptoms. The poster's emotions appear to be more related to the circumstances of the car damage and the responsibility of their friend.
