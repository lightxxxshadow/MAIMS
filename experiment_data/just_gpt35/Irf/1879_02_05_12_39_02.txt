Post:
  I met this girl month ago and i feel in love very quick. She is from Portugal and i am from Slovenia.. And we thought about having a long distance but she feels like its not gonna work. We talked about it 2 days ago and i told her i cant be there just friends because im only making myself suffer, she seems to have no problem with it, but i just cant get over myself and watching somebody drift away while i wait. It hurts so much and the things she said about me how amazing i am and how bad she wants me to stay there, but i just cant im falling into depression again. I told her im gonna stay but i dont know if im capable im just hurting myself. 3 years of this and just when you think you get out of it it crawls back so fast ahhhhh. And i feel like the most egoistical, needy piece of shit that i cant get over the fact its over. Fuck this shit and fuck life. Thanks for listening ‚ù§Ô∏è

The poster expresses feelings of being burdensome and feeling like a piece of shit for not being able to get over the fact that the relationship is over. They mention falling into depression again and feeling hurt.
