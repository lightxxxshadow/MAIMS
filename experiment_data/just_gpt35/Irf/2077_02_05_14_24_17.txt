Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've been on Christmas break for a few weeks and it's been absolutely wonderful. The fall semester was one of the worst experiences of my life, and I barely passed my four classes. This semester I'll be taking six just to catch up, and if I don't fail any of them I'll be shocked. Just the idea of being back there legitimately is less preferable than a quick and painless death. FUUUUUUCKK
