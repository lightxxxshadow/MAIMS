Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I told my mom what I have been going through earlier today through text. We live on opposite sides of the country. But, well she called me to scream at me that I wasn‚Äôt depressed and that I‚Äôm faking it. She‚Äôs blocked my number. I‚Äôm told that family will always be there. I guess fucking not. I don‚Äôt know where to go. I think I‚Äôm just gonna give up here I have been cut away from family I don‚Äôt have any friends and I‚Äôm so fucking tired of being alive

The post shows feelings of isolation, being cut off from family, and a desire to give up. These are indications of perceived burdensomeness, which is a risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior.
