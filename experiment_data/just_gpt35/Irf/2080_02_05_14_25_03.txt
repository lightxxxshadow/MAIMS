Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Not trying to sound like a post from Incels but I really wish I could find a girl that would like me back. I just feel so lonely sometimes and I just want someone to get close to and share the things I find amazing with. And on a more selfish note just having the validation and confidence booster in that I'm actually able to get a living breathing human to be interested in me for more than just friendship.
