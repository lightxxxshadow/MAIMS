Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I need some help. I've been having more anxiety again lately and I don't know what other medications there are to even try. I have tried so many different medications and they just aren't doing the job. I know I can go back to my psychiatrist and all, but I'd like to know if anyone else has any  unique  medications that I could keep in mind for some hope and possibly to bring up with the doc. Here is a website that I found that has a extensive list of anti anxiety meds, https://www.anxieties.com/152/introduction-common-medications-for-anxiety-disorders#.Wkf3p1Q-ei4, and I've tried all of the Benzo's and numerous from the other categories that are listed. Just looking for maybe something unique that someone else has had luck with. thanks!

The poster mentions feeling anxious and seeking help for their anxiety. They express frustration with not finding relief from previous medications and are looking for unique options. This suggests a potential feeling of thwarted belongingness, as they may feel disconnected from others in finding effective treatment for their anxiety.
