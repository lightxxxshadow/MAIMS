Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Every now and then when I feel a bit better and starting to build something in my life. I remember of the past and it ruins my insides. For most of you, my thoughts might be nothing... it is very important to me. I come from a very hard family. I grew up to hate alcohol because I saw my father drunk been horrible to my mother. And generally I was socially awkward. Even that, I was quite popular at the Uni. I dont know if it was the the long hair and my exotic colour but I knew loads of women were interested in me. But I couldnt do anything. And that is what destroys me. As everyone had their crash in uni. What destroys me it is that, some of those crashes that I had, I knew they were interested in me. And I could even sleep with some of them.. but I never did. I was virgin and still was 2 weeks ago. Now, I look back at all those pretty women that I liked and I probably do not exist to them. WHen I could be with them if I tried!
