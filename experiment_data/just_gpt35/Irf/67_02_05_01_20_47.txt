Post:
  Hello. I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much. I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand. To summarize for you all: * They were involved in some deep stuff. * Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head. * The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. &gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed. * They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment. * Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly. I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them. What can I do?

The post indicates that the individual is expressing concern about their friend's well-being and the burden they feel from not being able to physically be there for support. The mention of their friend's life crumbling and the lack of support from doctors and other friends further suggests feelings of being a burden.
