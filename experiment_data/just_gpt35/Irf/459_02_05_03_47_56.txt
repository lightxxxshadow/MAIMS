Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I dont want to call myself depressed, because I am happy sometimes I don‚Äôt want to say I‚Äôve been emotionally biasd, because it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt as bad as others and I don‚Äôt remember most of it I don‚Äôt want to say my dad left, because I still talk to him but I haven‚Äôt seen him in almost a full year I don‚Äôt want to say I have anxiety, because I don‚Äôt have panic attacks anymore I don‚Äôt want to say I used to cut, because I only did it for a few months I don‚Äôt want to make people mad because my problems aren‚Äôt that bad, so I just keep my mouth shut. Until someone asks, then I let loose. Yet, it‚Äôs still not bad enough to be anything worth while....
