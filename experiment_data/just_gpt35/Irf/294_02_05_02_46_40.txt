Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I got my gf pregnant. I don't know what to do and say. I havent slept for 3 days since we found out. She's 4 weeks pregnant and already thinking about  medical abortion . She's not talking to me. I'm having thoughts about killing myself to escape all of this. Its the most dumb thing to do but i feel like im running out of choices. We're not financially stable. I'm a student. I should have wore a condom. What should i do.

The post indicates feelings of isolation and social disconnection, as the individual states that their girlfriend is not talking to them. Additionally, the thoughts of killing oneself to escape the situation suggest a sense of hopelessness and a lack of belongingness.
