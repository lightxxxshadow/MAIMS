Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My best friend is literally the sweetest person ever she brought me so much chocolate and facemasks to make me happy, even if its just for a few seconds and I just can't stop crying about that. I really, really, really want to die, I even cut myself to prepare me mentally for it and if she would have known that I'm doing that right now, she knocked on my door and gave me that. I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want her to be sad because of my death but on the other hand I just can't stand this life anymore. Please help me. She is literally the only reason I am still alive.

The post indicates a strong reliance on the friend as the only reason for staying alive, suggesting a sense of belongingness. However, the statement of wanting to die and self-harm indicate a significant risk of thwarted belongingness.
