  I'll probably do it in my middle age. I don't want to die old and helpless. For now, I'll push on and I'll do my best for others even if it means dying.

The post does not indicate risk of thwarted belongingness. The individual expresses a willingness to do their best for others, even if it means sacrificing their own wellbeing and potentially dying. This suggests a sense of commitment and concern for others rather than a lack of belongingness.
