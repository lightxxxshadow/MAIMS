  My friend wants to cut everybody off Hi all. I talked to a friend a few days ago who is going through depression and she told me she wants to cut all of her friends and family off. I am taken aback — we’ve known each other since primary school! I just don’t know what to say. She says it isn’t anything personal and she just wants to end all of her relationships. Has anyone dealt with something similar?
