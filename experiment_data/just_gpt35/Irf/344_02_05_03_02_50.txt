Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

Post:
  And then my mate punched me in the face, and now I feel completely demotivated. It's like, what's the point, y'know? If I have fun, I get punched, if I'm upset, I get punched, if I say the wrong thing, I get punched, if I complain about it, I get punched! Like, what's the fucking point, y'know!?

The post indicates a sense of isolation and rejection due to being punched and criticized for various actions. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as the person feels that regardless of what they do, they face negative consequences and therefore question the point of trying.
