Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I can just enjoy myself at a party until a thought hits me and I suddenly lose all life in myself. I can be on Cloud 9 until some insignificant thing just makes me feel worthless. I hate it. I hate being sad all the time. I'm trying to just stay positive but things are easier said than done. It's hard, but for now, I'll have to deal with this overarching sadness.
