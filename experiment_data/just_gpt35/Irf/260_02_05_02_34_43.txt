Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hi everyone, I've been lurking on this reddit for a couple of months now, on and off, depending on my mood. It's always been uplifting to read the responses to the posts. The context of my problem is that I'll be looking for an internship in April of this year (my very first job), and I'm unsure if I can match up to the competition and impress a potential employer. However, that isn't what I wanted help with. My problem is that when I think about my prospects, I have attacks of what I'm pretty sure is called  anticipatory  anxiety, ranging from vague feelings of discomfort to hyperventilating panic attacks, almost always followed by a period of intense depressed lethargy where I am unable to do anything but stare at the ceiling and feel shitty about myself. This can last for anytime between 2-3 hours to a whole day. Needless to say, this is seriously hampering my productivity, and I'd like to ask about the r/depression community if they've ever experienced anything similar and what they've done to avoid or subdue these feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. Thanks in advance! EDIT: punctuation
