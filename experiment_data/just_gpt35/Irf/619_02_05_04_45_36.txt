Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Has some of you ever sometimes or all the times tell yourself that  I hate myself  like it just comes out out of nowhere? Or  I want to die . Like I can be in deep thought and it just comes out without me thinking like it's a habit or something. I sometimes have to look around to make sure no one heard me. Does anyone ever experience this? Am I explaining this clearly enough? Edit: thanks for all the comments today wasn't the best day for me or week for that matter. Y'all comments made me feel a little better. Especially Mr. Wicked91 thanks, man!!!!!
