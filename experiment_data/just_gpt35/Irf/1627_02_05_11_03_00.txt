The post indicates a possible risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual mentions feeling nauseated at the thought of food and not being able to go to work. These symptoms suggest that the person may be experiencing feelings of being overwhelmed or a lack of motivation to engage in daily activities, which can be associated with perceived burdensomeness.
