Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm frustrated with my life. I have very few friends, and as a 20 year old college student about to turn 21 it‚Äôs driving me crazy to realize that I can‚Äôt celebrate it with anyone. My closest friends are all younger than me, and 2 of the closest are 16 (don‚Äôt worry, I met them through my job, I‚Äôm not a pedophile), so I feel pathetic for being unable to make friends my own age. It‚Äôs just plain creepy. Only thing that keeps people from calling me out is that I look only a year older than them. I‚Äôm gay, in a hyper conservative family, so I can‚Äôt please anyone in it. I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I‚Äôm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I‚Äôm gay, I‚Äôm a pedophile. The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting. I try approaching the LGBT groups on campus but I feel like they‚Äôll ostracize me for other reasons. I feel like I was cheated my teenage years by my restrictive parents, now I‚Äôm lonely and angry at everyone around me for having what I couldn‚Äôt. My siblings are successful, and I feel like the dissappointment and failure of the family. I have much more anger but these are the ones that keep popping up today, and I just wanted to vent about it somewhere.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's post reveals a strong sense of loneliness, isolation, and a lack of belongingness. They express frustration about not being able to make friends their own age and feeling like they were cheated out of their teenage years. They also mention feeling like a disappointment and failure in their family. The answers to the mental scale questions further support this, as they indicate feelings of being a burden on society, thinking that others would be happier without them, and feeling disconnected from others. These are all indicators of thwarted belongingness.

Correct
Continue to carefully integrate the personal sentiments shared in social media posts with the responses given to questions on the mental health scale. Ensure that each conclusion about the poster's mental health is strongly supported by concrete information provided in both the post and the scale responses. Avoid making assumptions beyond the provided information, and remain vigilant for any biases that might lead to overgeneralizations or misattributions.
