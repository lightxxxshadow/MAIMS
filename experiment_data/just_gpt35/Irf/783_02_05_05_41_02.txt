Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  We ended up arguing and he told me I was spoilt and I was being manipulative?? I started crying and kept repeating the same things over and over again. I'm so extremely embarrassed and I wish more than anything I hadn't told him. I feel stupid and pathetic because of how much I kept repeating myself...

The repetitive behavior, feeling embarrassed and pathetic, and the mention of being called manipulative suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness.
