Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've been going to therapy for about 5 months now and I've noticed some improvements in my anxiety and depression. I've been going through CBT which has lots of research support, but I always find myself slacking off on changing my behaviours and when I do that. I revert back to being depressed and suicidal. I guess I'm kind of looking for an easy fix as crazy as that sounds. Those who have gone on medication like Zoloft, Ativan, Xanax, Prozac. How was your experience with them? Did they help things or make things worse? Would it be beneficial to take meds along with therapy? I'm honestly tired of feeling like shit constantly, it's eating me alive.

The poster mentions feeling like a burden as they state that they are tired of feeling like shit constantly and that it is eating them alive. This indicates a risk of perceived burdensomeness, a concept often associated with suicidal ideation.
