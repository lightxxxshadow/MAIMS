Post:
  On top of my depression and all the haunting failures and shortcomings of my 30-year life, the person whom I love and wanted to be with is right now on a beach in Rio amid millions of people watching the fireworks. While I am here, alone, in my bedroom. Happy 2017. I hope we can all get through this, somehow.
