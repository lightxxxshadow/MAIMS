Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I've recently started a blog where I'm posting my poetry and other thoughts on depression, anxiety, and life. Does anyone else blog about their depression? This is my blog, feel free to check it out: misunderstoodmammal.com

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness because the poster is seeking connection and community by asking if anyone else blogs about their depression. They also provide a link to their blog, indicating a desire for others to check it out and potentially engage with their content.
