Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Life can go fuck itself. I think I'm done. I'm a mechanical engineer graduate. I came from a different country to the United States to study engineering, hoping I can make something out of myself. I poured blood sweat and tears trying to get good grades and graduate proudly. I never went to parties, stayed away from drugs, focused on having good relationships with people and overall being kind wherever I could. This country does not want to hire me at all.. Wherever I send my applications I get rejects. This was my only dream and meant everything in life. All my friends and moved on getting jobs. I have an excellent profile and some really good work to show for but the leadership is a little unpredictable, so companies don't what to hire people like me.. I watched so many people cheat their way through exams and projects and gone to get hired by companies like Amazon and Google. I have not seen my family in three years. And can barely afford to eat more than one meal a day. I'm getting recurring nightmares of being a failure and this makes me want to end it all. I've decided to stay in the US as long as I legally can. Then then, if I'm not getting a job.. I'm simply ending it. I have nothing else to live for. Oh and becomes this, I have fucking health problems.. So who knows how long I'll be alive anyway. Life is unfair.. So life can go fuck itself. I'm out.
