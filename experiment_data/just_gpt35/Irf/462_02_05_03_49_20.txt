Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Everyday I could be fine but eventually the thought of my death creeps in to my thought and it makes me sad. I have been questioning what is on the other side all my life and sometimes I just think I should kill myself to get it over with. My friends don't help either most of the are sorta surface level and the ones closest to me are the most negative. I just want to have fun in life I'm only 16 why do I think about it so much ? I don't even care to experience homeschool anymore I am just trying to go to college.

The poster mentions feeling sad and having thoughts of death, as well as feeling a lack of support from their friends. These feelings of isolation and distance from others indicate a possible risk of thwarted belongingness.
