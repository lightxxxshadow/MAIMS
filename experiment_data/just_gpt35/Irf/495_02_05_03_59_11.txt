  Hi reddit, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself, and hopefully meet a great community to help me on my journey. I a'm a very quiet person, don't get much attention, and I spend all my time at home or at school.I'm 17 years old and tonight is my last day of Christmas break, and my last day of childhood since tomorrow is my 18th birthday (technically today since my birthday January 4th and it's already 1:50AM).I have spent my night drinking, smoking, and crying. The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight. Tomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I will be replying to comments tomorrow after school, good night to everyone and I hope you all have as great of a day as I will tomorrow.

The post suggests feelings of low self-esteem, self-criticism, and a sense of unfulfillment in life. The mention of drinking, smoking, and crying, as well as the acknowledgment of depression indicates a possible risk of perceived burdensomeness.
