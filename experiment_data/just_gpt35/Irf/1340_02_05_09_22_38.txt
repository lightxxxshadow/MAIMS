Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  i‚Äôve always been the type to be super unmotivated when doing things whether it‚Äôs my ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù or school and super introverted and not confident at all, but last year i joined a pageant and it really brought my confidence up for a while. I‚Äôm going to sound super conceited when i say this but during practice and rehearsals, the other girls were always asking me for advice on their walk and poses and saying that for sure i would win something. during the competition on nye i didn‚Äôt make any mistakes with choreography and a few judges even came over and told me i was their number one pick for queen. there were 12 girls in the competition and 6 awards total. in the end i didn‚Äôt win anything.... once again i‚Äôm going to sound so conceited but i personally felt super confident and i thought there was no way i would not get anything. but lo and behold i didn‚Äôt win a single thing. I basically have solid evidence that 4/6 of the winners had hella connections and sponsors and that‚Äôs why they won. but still... it just feels like i‚Äôve wasted so much time and effort on something that was rigged in the first place. i was thinking that it would be like ‚Äúnew year new me i might actually work harder for some things because winning would be proof that something can come out of it if i try hard enough‚Äù.... but now my confidence is at an all time low and idk what to do.... sorry just felt like ranting a bit sigh

The post does not show significant signs of thwarted belongingness. The writer expresses disappointment and low confidence following the pageant, but there is no clear indication of feeling excluded or socially disconnected from others.
