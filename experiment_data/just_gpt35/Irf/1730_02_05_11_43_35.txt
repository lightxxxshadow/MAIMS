Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hi, 23 M have been living with depression for at least 8 years, maybe longer i've kinda forgotten when it started its been so long. Been at the tipping point for a while now, although for some reason my death would upset some people so i refuse to do it as much as i want to. Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live. The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help? Like i don't actually like this world and even if my attitude changed my situation wouldn't, and if anything relying on pure hope to get me through another 50~ years of despair would just be more painful than accepting it?

The post suggests feelings of social disconnection and the belief that the individual's death would upset others, which aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
