Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  You don't understand why I stopped being a lawyer and became a writer. You don't understand why I want to move abroad and left the city I always wanted to live in. You don't understand any of my choices. I understand you. You want me to be safe. What you don't know I'm fighting depression and suicidal thoughts. I need to be happy. I know I should already know how to be happy being 30 years old, but I don't. Some days I even don't know who I am. Who I really am. I am only surviving. I wish you could understand how I am feeling.
