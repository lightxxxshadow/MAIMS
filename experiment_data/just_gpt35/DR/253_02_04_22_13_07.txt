Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I haven't felt anything in over a month. I have struggled with depression for a few years now, and I was doing really well. I met a girl online that seemed absolutely perfect, and she made me feel truly happy for the first time since I was little. In October, she just stopped replying to me. She sent a message a few weeks later faking to be a family member and lied about committing suicide. I just feel nothing anymore after that.
