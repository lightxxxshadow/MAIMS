Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I gave up all the weed and alcohol that I was doing last semester, but it was the only thing that helped. I feel like I have no one at all. I ruin everything and every friendship i have. If I don't get on something that takes me away from this dark, dark room that's my head, I cannot last long. This is all too much. Is there anybody out there even reading this? Will anyone care?

Yes
The post indicates feelings of being a burden, thinking that others would be better off without them, and feeling like they make things worse for the people in their life. These thoughts align with the concept of perceived burdensomeness, which is a key feature of risk for suicide.

Correct
Ensure that each inference is grounded in specific evidence from the social media post and the scale responses. Avoid overstating or inserting information that is not presented. Stay objective and continue to draw connections between the individual's expressed feelings and the scale responses to accurately assess their mental health.
