Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  only got an hour's worth of sleep last night because I've been too uncomfortable to sleep lately without exhausting myself into passing out, and today i felt so light (still feel nauseated and jittery sometimes, that hasn't changed haha) and generally somehow just better than I've been for the past few weeks. of course that's really the sleep deprivation making me giddy, but when ive felt sluggish for so long, highs like this like, blow my mind. i really dont want to sleep tonight, for mood swing reasons (and for schoolwork too). anyone else get an hour or two of sleep on the regular? ... really wanna invest in caffeine pills, despite the obvious negative effects of lack sleep. i really have no other way of feeling good.

The mention of feeling uncomfortable and being unable to sleep suggests that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of anxiety or insomnia. The desire to exhaust oneself to the point of passing out and the reliance on sleep deprivation to feel better are concerning behaviors. Additionally, the mention of mood swings and wanting to avoid sleep for schoolwork reasons may indicate a possible risk of thwarted belongingness, as the poster may feel disconnected or isolated.
