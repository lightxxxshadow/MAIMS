Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Life is really hard even tho my life is relatively good for now but I am not happy. Everyday I question why I‚Äôm in college hating every second of it. To work for the rest of my life? For what? Why am I so lazy and unmotivated. My least favorite thing about college is the PEOPLE. I just want to stay inside. I had to skip therapy this week because I have too much pointless school work to do. I‚Äôm lucky to even have therapy but I won‚Äôt anymore when I turn 25. I am 23 now.
