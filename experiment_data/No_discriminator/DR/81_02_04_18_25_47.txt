Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I'm having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend Long story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I'll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off While I get the whole  friends mess with each other  idea, but it just doesn't fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I'm a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc. On the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can't help it I don't know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn't seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of:  he doesn't mean anything by it, it's just how he is don't get offended . But unfortunately, we don't mix that way. Now Jeff's not inherently a bad person, when he's serious he's actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate. But his behavior to me on a day to day basis just really really pisses me off
