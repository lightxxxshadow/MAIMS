Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm using a new account because I can't remember my old password for my main account. But yeah I'm probably dead tonight. Im 20 and moved from the East coast to St Louis about 5 months ago ( it feels longer ). I got a good job delivering but quit it almost two weeks ago because I'm a bitch and was having an anxiety attack. I don't know what's wrong with me. A bit before quitting I went into the er because I was suicidal and spent 4 days trapped and with no actual help. I faked being better to get out. My only friends were at this job and they're mad at me ( understandably ). My old roommates are holding some of my stuff hostage until I pay them a certain amount of money. I've been couch surfing for the entire time up here. This was stupid. I hate myself. Sorry if it's not making too much sense I can't think straight right now. It doesn't matter either way.
