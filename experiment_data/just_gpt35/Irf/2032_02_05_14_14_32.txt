Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So back in 2015 I had this girlfriend, my first one, long story short we broke up and I got major depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm(cutting, snapping, punching) for about a year. Luckily by mid 2016 I managed to get out of it but after the holidays I found out after I left year 11 and went onto a new sixth form this girl, my ex, is now at the same sixth form/ college as me and this is completely screwing me up, she told all her friends about all the stupid shit I said to her that I would've preferred to keep private, which in turn means they are all judging me, apparently they are calling me names and I'm basically being bullied. Not only that but there are these people in my computing class who started out being my friends but slowly I think they are just starting to bully me too, there was this picture I uploaded 2 years ago to my Instagram of me in a onesie that they keep teasing me about, they even went so far as to print it off and put it in my pocket so as to piss my off when I find it. I really don't want to go back to college as I don't want to face all of this again, i really think it's going to break me and pull me back to cutting and sucical thoughts, even though the thoughts have already started again. I'm honestly on my last legs here, and I feel that this next year and a half of my life are going to be the darkest times for me.
