  Because maybe I'm called  weak ,  a pussy , or an  attention seeker  when I do. One of the WORST things about having depression is dealing with ignorant assholes and the stigma. The stigma itself is why we refuse to tell anyone. I just want to know when people will wake up and realize that this thing isn't some kind of joke and that it is KILLING people.
