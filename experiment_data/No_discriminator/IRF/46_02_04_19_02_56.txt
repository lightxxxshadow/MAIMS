Yes
The poster's responses on the mental scale indicate feelings of being a burden, thoughts of making things worse for others, feeling disconnected, and a lack of satisfying interactions. These are all indicators of thwarted belongingness, which refers to the perception of not having social connections or feeling like an outsider. The poster's blog about depression and anxiety further suggests a desire for connection and understanding from others who may share similar experiences.
