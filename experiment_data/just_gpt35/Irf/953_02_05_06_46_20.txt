True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I just felt like jumping from a high rise building, I almost went near the edge but I don't know what made me back out. I have been on anti depressants since 2 years and was coping well. But since my mom passed away last month at the age of 50 I am not who I am. I am just not finding any meaning in life. Right now I am feeling numb and my heart is pounding. It feels terrible.
