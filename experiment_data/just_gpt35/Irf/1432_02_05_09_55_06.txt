Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  A close (at least I thought she was close to me) friend lied to me that she doesn't celebrate New Year and doesn't go anywhere, but she was in a cafe last night. By the way I heard from a friend that she saw her there with another friend drunk af. So, what should I do? She was my only female friend (I'm male by the way) and I really thought we are getting in a real friendship. I don't want to tell her for now, but what do you suggest I do? EDIT: Well, at least now I have a reason to hate someone else instead of hating and blaming myself all the time.

The poster's statement about feeling hurt by their friend's lie and their emphasis on this friend being their only female friend suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness. Thwarted belongingness refers to a feeling of social disconnection or rejection.
