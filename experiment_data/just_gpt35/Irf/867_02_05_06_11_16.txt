Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have never been diagnosed with depression, although my girlfriend has. She frequently has periods of extremely low moods that can go on for days or even weeks, and has attempted suicide in the past. Whenever I see her like this it eats me apart from the inside with guilt, because I feel like it's my responsibility to help her and make her feel better and when I can't I feel like shit. I feel like a failure whenever this happens and I don't know what to do. Does anyone here know what to do? Or how to help? I hate watching this happen to her and I feel so guilty.
