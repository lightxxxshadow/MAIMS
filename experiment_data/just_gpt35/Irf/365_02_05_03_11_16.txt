  Then I bet there would be people that would stay alive due to the limited amount of suffering and happiness that they could feel but then again it's all a pipe dream. Funny how some pipe dreams would really help humanity and David Pearce abolition of suffering idea would be the best suicide prevention tool ever.

The post expresses the idea that reducing suffering and eliminating burdens could be beneficial for humanity. The mention of David Pearce's abolition of suffering as the best suicide prevention tool suggests a perception of burdensomeness, where the poster may see themselves or others as burdens to society.
