Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I really am having a hard time with life. Nothing in my life seems worth achieving or working for. I'm emotionally filled with self hatred to the point where I just want to end it all. I harm myself fairly often and it does little to quell my disgust in myself. I am barely holding on. I would have done it earlier but I couldn't find any blades.

The post indicates feelings of self-hatred, a desire to end one's life, and self-harm. These are all indicative of perceived burdensomeness, as the poster may believe that they are a burden to themselves and others and that their life has no value or purpose.
