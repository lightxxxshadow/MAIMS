  Am I surrounding myself with people who will positively influence me? Am I going to be fucked over in this relationship like the one before? What's going to happen to me I almost don't really want to find out

The post suggests feelings of isolation or disconnection as the individual questions whether they are surrounding themselves with positively influential people. Additionally, the fear of being hurt in a relationship and the reluctance to find out what will happen indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which refers to the perception that one does not have satisfying interpersonal relationships.
