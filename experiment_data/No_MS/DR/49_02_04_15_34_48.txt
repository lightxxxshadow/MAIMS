Consider only current symptoms and avoid assuming a diagnosis based on past feelings. The post does mention feeling 'extra crap' and physical symptoms that could be associated with depression but does not provide definitive evidence of current depression. Focus on the information provided without over inferring past conditions as current ones. A more cautious approach could be recommending a professional evaluation for a potential depression diagnosis.
