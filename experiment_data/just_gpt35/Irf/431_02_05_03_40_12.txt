  Oh wait, it's only 5th of Jan? Oh boy, seemed so long inside my head. :/ Jokes apart, feels good, even if it's for a short amount of time, during a warm shower.

The post does not show any direct indication of perceived burdensomeness. The poster is talking about the passing of time and feeling good during a warm shower, which does not suggest a high level of perceived burdensomeness.
