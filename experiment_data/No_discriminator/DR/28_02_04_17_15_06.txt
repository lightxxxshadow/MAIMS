Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Looking for friends. I'm a socially awkward college student that'd like to make some friends. Not necessarily hangin out (would be nice sometimes) but just want people to talk too, so it's all good if you don't live near me. :)
