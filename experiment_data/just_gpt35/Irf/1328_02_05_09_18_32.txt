Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I am a male and am 16 years old, I took biology, chemistry, maths and philosophy for my A levels, and I don't know what to do. I had in mind that I would become a doctor, but then I read, that they have to mostly spend weekends working and work overtime. That made me depressed. I thought I had it all figured but, then I realised that I don't really know anymore if I want to become a doctor. I really don't know that much about myself, but I know that I can't be bothered to work over hours. I like to make songs, and sing, and edit videos, but I really don't know what career to take from those, especially since I have already started a level with those subjects. I was thinking of giving YouTube a go, but my parents most likely won't approve at all. Do I keep doing a medical course or stop? Should I try some new things whilst studying? I really need help, I am starting to just waste my life being depressed and thinking on how good all these social stars get paid, and don't have to go to college, whilst I am here just depressed thinking about my future.

The poster expresses feelings of being unsure about their future career choice and experiencing depression and dissatisfaction with their current situation. They also mention feeling isolated and envious of social media stars who do not have to attend college. These feelings could indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness, as the poster may feel disconnected and lacking a sense of purpose or meaningful connections.
