The post suggests that the person experiences a pattern of feeling good for a short period of time before returning to depression. This inconsistency and the mention of self-destructive behaviors indicate a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the person may feel like a burden to others due to their repeated struggles with depression and self-destructive behaviors.
