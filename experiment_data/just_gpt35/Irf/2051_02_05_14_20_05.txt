Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm suicidal because, of, I failed graduating many times, school. How my dad treats me, bullying me. How I make myself feel awful by judging myself all the time, me. I'm unmotivated in school, I dread school, I hate school. I'm a highly sensitive person, hsp. I'm a procrastinator. Suicide has become a normal thing for me. Even in better days, I think about suicide, ways to die. I just wanna give up on life, on school and die. . I probably have more reasons but this is it
