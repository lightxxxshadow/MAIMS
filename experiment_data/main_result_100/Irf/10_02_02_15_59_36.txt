Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post shows signs of thwarted belongingness because the poster feels disconnected from other people, thinks they make things worse for others, believes they are a burden on society, and feels that no one cares about them.

Correct
Continue to integrate information from social media posts and mental health scales thoughtfully, avoiding assumptions not supported by data. Be careful not to overgeneralize or infer negative characteristics without evidence.
