Post:
  If nothing changes by the end of the year I've decided to kill myself. I can't live like this anymore. I'm so tried. I'm sick of failing in life again and again and again I'm sick of people calling me crazy I'm of being treated like crap I'm sick of life. If nothing changes by the end of the year I plan on killing myself before I turn 20. IM SO TRIED I WANT IT TO END I WANT RELIEF

The post indicates a clear intent to end one's life due to feeling tired and exhausted with life and being unable to handle repeated failures and mistreatment. This suggests a perceived burdensomeness and a desire for relief through suicide.
