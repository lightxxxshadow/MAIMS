Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Afraid to post my own comments/opinions on social media. I'm just realizing that all of the social medias I have or use (IG/ Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit and so on) I only repost/like other users posts and rarely post my own.. Idk seems like I'm afraid of what others think of me and that I'm insecure about something

Do Mental Health Analysis:

No
The poster indicates feelings of insecurity and fear of judgement, which may suggest social anxiety or low self-esteem, but it does not necessarily indicate depression.

Correct
While analyzing mental health from a post, avoid diagnosing without sufficient evidence. Focus on the information provided and the behaviors or feelings expressed rather than inferring clinical conditions not mentioned. This will ensure a more accurate analysis and prevent overreaching conclusions.
