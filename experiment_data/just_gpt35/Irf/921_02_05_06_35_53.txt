Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I want to be succesful but I'm currently struggling with depression/anxiety. I'm 18 and I'm really lost at life, almost dropping out of high school due to the complete utter unmotivation to study whatever comes. And I have no interest in anything probably because of the depression. Thank for your time, I appreciate it.
