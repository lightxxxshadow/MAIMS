Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Anyone ever wish they were good at something? Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy.
