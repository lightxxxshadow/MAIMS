True Label:	No
Post:
  So, pretty much. I‚Äôve been dealing with depression &amp; anxiety for quite a number of years, but I‚Äôve going through a real low, rough patch at the moment. My self hatred has been growing rapidly &amp; to top it off, me and my now ex girlfriend broke up the other day. I was just wondering if any of you could just comment some positive things like inspiration and whatnot? Thank you all in advance. I hope everyone that‚Äôs reading this right now are coping alright, you‚Äôre never alone ‚ù§Ô∏è
