Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I get it. I'm awkward at parties. I'd probably say no if you invited me to a huge party anyway. Doesn't mean I don't want to be invited. And when it's 4 or 5 of my 'closest friends' all having fun and playing board games together and no one wanted me to be there it makes me feel the worst I've felt since I started taking antidepressants. I don't want to feel like this any more. I don't want to feel anything any more. I spent so long trying to convince myself that there's no huge fucking glaring flaw with my personality that drives people away but I guess the universe just keeps trying to convince me otherwise. Why is this so hard
