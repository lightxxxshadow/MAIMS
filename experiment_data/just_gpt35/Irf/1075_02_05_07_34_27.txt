Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I believe that when I find my place in this world that I will be complete and normal. Right now and since years I feel lost and don't know what I want, don't know what I have to do, don't know if the answer is yes or no. I tried. I tried finding a solution. I tried finding purpose. I tried finding something that makes me a whole. I know it's not *something* I am looking for, it's rather *myself*. I am the shell of myself and I need my inner core back but it's gone. And I'm done looking for it. I waited long enough. I endured so much. I endured so many bad things. In the end.. a shell without it's core is going to fall together sooner or later. It's time.

The post reveals feelings of being lost, not knowing one's purpose, and feeling incomplete. There is a strong sense of despair and a desire to find oneself. These feelings and thoughts may indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the poster seems to believe that they are a burden to themselves and possibly others.
