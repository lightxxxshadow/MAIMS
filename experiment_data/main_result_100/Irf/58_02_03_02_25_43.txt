Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  In this world full of wifi connection, human connection seems obsolete. I feel so alone. It's a cliche feeling, I know. Me against the world and nobody is on my side. The world is winning, etc. But I just feel so down. So so so depressed. I told myself that this 2018 I will embrace what is real - real people, real words, real friends. And then I realized everyone around me is fake. I envy those people who have friends who stick with them whatever happens. I wonder if I could still find real friends nowadays. Just one real friend would be nice. Just so I don't feel this way anymore. Some will say this too shall pass but it has been weeks and it ain't done yet.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post demonstrates feelings of loneliness, disconnection, envy of others' friendships, and a desire for at least one real friend. The individual expresses a longing for meaningful human connection and states that everyone around them feels fake. These symptoms indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness, which refers to a perceived lack of social connection and the feeling of being disconnected from others.

Correct
Continue to carefully analyze the emotional content and language of posts along with responses from mental health scales to assess mental health risks accurately. Avoid over-inferencing by sticking only to the information provided, without assuming additional negative characteristics. Ensure you differentiate between statements about oneself and others to maintain precise evaluations about the individual's feelings towards personal social connections and belongingness.
