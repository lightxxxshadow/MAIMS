Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Got married at 25 to my ex (then 23) after four years of dating back in 2014. She called it quits by March 2015 after less than a year of marriage. She moved out in April 2015, and I've had very little contact since last Summer. She finally got around to having us exchange divorce paperwork a few months back, and on Jan 12 we'll be having a quick trial for a no-fault divorce. This was never a separation I wanted. I went from marriage counseling directly to weekly individual therapy last year, though I had found it unhelpful and stopped going after a few months. I feel like I annoy my friends when I try to talk to them about this, and there's always stuff going on in the back of my mind about this. I just want out of this mess, but I know in two weeks that even though there may be some legal closure, emotionally I'm not optimistic that things will be final. As a 28 year old guy, I hate that so much time has past and I still feel stuck and like shit. How do I get through this?

The post indicates feelings of isolation and loneliness, as the poster mentions having very little contact with their ex and feeling like they annoy their friends when they try to talk about their situation. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, where the individual feels disconnected and excluded from meaningful social connections.
