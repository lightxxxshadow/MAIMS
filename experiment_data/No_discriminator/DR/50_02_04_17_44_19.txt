Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My hands won't do what I want them to. I know I know I've ranted about not being able to do anything artistic a thousand times now, but this is different. A few times I've forced myself to draw I was garbage, but I figured that's to be expected since I haven't done it in a while. However lately I've found playing video games much more difficult because I find myself pressing the wrong button almost purposely, or not reacting to something my brain processed seconds ago. It's even gotten to the point where typing is difficult for me--every other letter I find myself making a stupid typo, and its irritating. It shouldn't take every ounce of will and concentration to type a stupid reddit post, yet here we are........
