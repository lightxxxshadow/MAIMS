Yes
The responses to the mental scale questions indicate that the poster feels disconnected from other people, believes they are a burden on society, thinks others would be better off without them, and feels that no one cares about them. These are all indicators of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for suicide. Therefore, the post shows a risk of thwarted belongingness.
