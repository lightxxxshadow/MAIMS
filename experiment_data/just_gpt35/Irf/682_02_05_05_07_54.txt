Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  First time on antidepressants but I've been on them for 4 months now. I like the meds I'm on now and if I have an issue then I'll make an appointment with my psychiatrist is what I thought. But when I called my pharmacy they said I was out of refills. Is there any way I can just keep getting refills without having to keep visiting my Dr to renew the prescription? Is there a reason why I need to keep seeing this psychiatrist just to sit in a waiting room for 2 hours just to say hey I need refills?

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. The poster is expressing frustration with having to keep visiting their psychiatrist just to get refills for their antidepressant medication. This suggests a concern about the inconvenience and time-consuming nature of the process, but it does not indicate a lack of belonging or connectedness with others.
