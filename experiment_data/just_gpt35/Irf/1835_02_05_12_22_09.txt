Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I posted it here and people didn't believe me back then, I cared about it before but I don't care anymore. I'm serving in the military and I feel shit about it. I feel broken inside, I changed in a very bad way. I started having brake-downs and even wetting the bed. I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and the worse part is that I still have 2 years left (I served 1 year so far). I haven't told anyone about wetting the bed as I'm not 4 years old. And frankly speaking I just don't want to think about it. I'm thinking about just ending it sometimes... But I don't want to cause my family and friends any unnecessary sorrow. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate my life. If you read so far, thank you.
