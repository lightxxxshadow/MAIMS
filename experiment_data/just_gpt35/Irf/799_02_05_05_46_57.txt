Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Back to work tomorrow after a week and a half off. I love my job, but I am so uncomfortable around my coworkers. I've been thinking about transferring but that is hard for a lot of reasons. Knowing I have to go to work tomorrow has me really just messed up in the head.

The post does not indicate risk of perceived burdensomeness. The poster mentioned feeling uncomfortable around coworkers and considering a transfer, which may suggest social anxiety or discomfort in the workplace, but it does not specifically imply feelings of being a burden on others.
