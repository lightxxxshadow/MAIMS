Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I want to keep going. I want to have things to look forward to. But I don‚Äôt. I really don‚Äôt want to end it. It seems like the only option right now. Everyone has cut me off, and the few people that have noticed that I am not myself aren‚Äôt able to do anything to help me. Just living right now is painful. I have nothing left. I‚Äôm sorry to those that cared about me. I just can‚Äôt handle it anymore. I‚Äôm planning to be gone by the end of the night. I don‚Äôt know how or where, but I‚Äôm over it.

The post indicates that the individual feels cut off from others and states that the few people who have noticed their distress are unable to help. This suggests a sense of social disconnection and potentially a risk of thwarted belongingness.
