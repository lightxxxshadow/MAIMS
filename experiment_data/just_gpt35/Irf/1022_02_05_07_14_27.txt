Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Thank you all so much for making 2017 an actually bearable year. Just reading how kind and caring you guys are to each other is incredible. It‚Äôs amazing how strong some of you are. Pulling through the tough times you‚Äôve all been through. Dealing with your depression or the depression of a friend or family member is a really hard thing to do. Those of you who can actually wake up every morning and do something with their lives are some of the strongest and bravest people I have ever seen. At the end of the day we‚Äôre all different people dealing with the same exact problem, depression. I know I don‚Äôt know any of you, but I‚Äôm proud you fight your depression and I‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôre alive. You‚Äôre all amazing people. Whether you see it or not. Thank you r/depression for helping me feel better when I‚Äôm in a dark place.
