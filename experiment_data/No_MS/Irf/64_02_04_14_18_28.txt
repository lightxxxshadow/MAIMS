Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  and things get really bad so that i can finally kill myself. I'm so sick of not able to kill myself because there is always this voice saying it's not that bad and not having enough courage because things are not that bad. There is no point anymore in trying so hard every year when nothing gets better. I'm so tired of living like this and waiting for nothing. And happy new year to everyone with mental illness and i hope this year turn out to be great for you all.

Yes
The post mentions feeling tired of living and waiting for nothing, indicating a sense of hopelessness and disconnection. The desire to kill oneself and the mentioned voice suggesting it's not that bad highlights potential feelings of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for suicide.

Incorrect
Avoid assuming feelings of thwarted belongingness without clear evidence of social disconnection specifically. Focus on direct expressions related to social relationships when addressing questions about belongingness. Here, the focus should be on the expressed hopelessness and suicidal ideation rather than an assumed thwarted belongingness.

ITER 1
No
The post primarily expresses feelings of hopelessness, tiredness, and suicidal ideation. While the poster mentions not feeling able to kill themselves, the focus is more on their overall despair and lack of improvement in their life. There is no clear evidence of social disconnection or thwarted belongingness specifically mentioned in the post.

Incorrect
When analyzing for thwarted belongingness, focus on the individualâ€™s expressions regarding relationships and feelings of connection or disconnection with others. The poster's expression of wanting things to get worse so they can justify suicide may imply a sense of not belonging or feeling disconnected, as it suggests that their current level of distress is not being recognized or validated by others, which could contribute to feelings of thwarted belongingness. It is important not to overlook potential indications of social isolation or perceived burdensomeness when they are implicitly suggested alongside other signs of distress. Re-evaluate the post for subtle hints of thwarted belongingness and consider such nuances in your analysis.

Correct
Your deduction is appropriate based on the content of the post. Continue to evaluate the explicit expressions of the poster when assessing their sense of belonging, but always cross-examine with other elements in the context to avoid over-inference. If you encounter more nuanced or ambiguous posts, be cautious not to attribute feelings or intentions to the poster that are not clearly stated.
