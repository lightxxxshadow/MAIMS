Post:
  Lost and Alone Hi, I’m 19 and I’m at my low point. Up until last year my life was pretty good, but now everything has fallen apart and I have no clue where to start picking up the pieces... I’ll keep it short, but I found out my parents were getting divorced when I came home from college on spring break. I don’t have a lot of friends and no close friends to confide in. The only people I do talk to are leaving for college soon (I’m staying home now) and the only thing I had left was my girlfriend who cheated on me. I know I’m young and I’ll grow from this but I’m lost and I don’t know what to do..
