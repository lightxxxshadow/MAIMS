Post:
  No matter how low you feel ( I've been low for years now ) just try and find the light that's there! Life is a precious gift and we can get through this we all can! Just have hope and faith in yourself. Trust me I know that's hard I never listen to my own advice. I just want you all to know anyone reading this if you feel down like I do or just want someone to talk about your problems to im here! I know I posted something saying I wish I was dead the other day but that's the depression talking!! Anyone message me I'm here.
