Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  This is my first NYE being 21, and I'm sick as fuck. I have a terrible stomach flu and all I wanted was to go downtown in a nice outfit and do drinking things. But instead, I'm sick, I'm alone, I'm supposed to work tomorrow, I'm in hell. New Year's is the only holiday besides Halloween that I care about, and I'm suffering on it. I had such a nice plan to see a friend I haven't seen in months. We were going to go out with a group and come back to her place and smoke. I'm a very lowkey kind of person, but I was looking forward to not being myself on New Year's and going out and actually letting go and that's not happening. It's all just the icing on the shit cake that's been this month and especially this year.

The poster expresses feelings of loneliness and disappointment in not being able to participate in their planned activities for New Year's Eve. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as they feel excluded from socializing and connecting with others during a holiday that is important to them.
