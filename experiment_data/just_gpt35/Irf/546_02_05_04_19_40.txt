Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm 15 and I have zero friends. Nobody reaches out to me and i‚Äôm not romantically pursued. I‚Äôve literally threatened suicide multiple times (for attention) and not a single person asked me if I was okay. All I have left is daydreaming and I just am not present anymore which is shitty because my exams are coming up and I have no motivation or capability to revise due to my lack of acceptance of the present. I just want to know what i‚Äôm doing wrong with people for myself to be completely invisible. I feel incredibly isolated and I just want to feel alive. Also I forgot to address the title, i‚Äôm constantly questioning whether i‚Äôm real because the amount that people ignore me seems statistically impossible. Pretty sure i‚Äôm borderline too.

The poster expresses feelings of isolation, a lack of acceptance from others, and a desire to feel alive. They also mentioned threatening suicide for attention, which suggests a strong need for connection and belonging. These factors indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a potential precursor to suicidal ideation.
