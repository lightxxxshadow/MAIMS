Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I just want to sleep all the time because if I'm sleeping, I'm not hurting. I'm too young to drink legally and I don't currently have a fake so I can't really self-medicate with alcohol too frequently. I'm about to go on a higher dose of meds which will hopefully numb me out more. Lately my main way has been escaping all negative thoughts through sleeping or video games. Maybe going back to college in a few weeks will help me? Idk. I want some suggestions for dealing with pain

The post suggests that the individual is experiencing pain and is using sleep and video games as a means of escape. They mention wanting to numb themselves with an increased dosage of medication and express uncertainty about whether going back to college will help. These could be indications of a perceived burden on others as the person might feel that their pain and coping mechanisms are a burden to those around them.
