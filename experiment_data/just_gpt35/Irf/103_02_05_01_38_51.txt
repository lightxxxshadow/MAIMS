Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Basically, I developed a really big crush on this girl. It was the only time I've ever seen my self being in a relationship. And get this! She had a crush on me too! I was so happy. I was going to ask her out last night at a NYE party, it's the only reason I went. But I missed my chance. Whatever, I'm hanging out with her and some other people tomorrow, I'll ask her then. Never-fucking-mind. I got a text from her a couple hours ago. She said she just wanted to be friends. I respected her, I didn't want to be a creep like a guy from r/incels. I told her I got it. I didn't get it. She liked me last night. I know she did. And today she didn't. I don't get now feelings for a person could come and go like that. The worst part? One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November. I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain. I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts. I just want to be clear, I still want to be her friend. But I still have a crush on her, despite what she made me do. All my old coping mechanisms didn't work. I can't get her out of my head. I can't stop thinking of it'd be different if I asked her out last night.
