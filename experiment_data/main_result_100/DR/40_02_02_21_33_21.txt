Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  That orange message-notification... It makes me happy, wanted, feeling like I belong. I love comments because I feel so alone in all of this. Even if the comment didn't help a lot, I feel like I'm not alone. Oh god I'm so miserable. EDIT: No its not a cry for attention or likes or upvotes. I sincerely feel good when I see the people of /r/depression commenting on my posts, and I love commenting on theirs. A mutual feeling of belonging...

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's answers to the questions of the mental scale indicate symptoms of depression such as sadness, pessimism, self-dislike, self-accusations, feeling worthless, loss of energy, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, and changes in sleeping pattern. These symptoms suggest that the poster is likely suffering from depression.

Incorrect
Ensure that the analysis accurately reflects the information provided. The student incorrectly stated that the poster experienced changes in sleeping pattern, while the answered questions clearly indicate that there were no changes in the sleeping pattern. Double-check each claim against the given data to avoid over-inference. Only infer about the poster's mental health based on direct evidence from their responses and not from any assumptions or generalizations.

ITER 1
Yes
Based on the answered questions, the poster's responses indicate feelings of sadness, pessimism, self-dislike, self-accusations, worthlessness, loss of energy, difficulty concentrating, and tiredness or fatigue. These responses align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.

Correct
Your analysis seems accurate based on the poster's expressions of chronic sadness, loneliness, and the answered questions indicating several symptoms common in depression. Still, remain cautious against over-inference and ensure each symptom is supported by the post’s content and scale answers. Continuously verify that provided statements closely reflect the individual's experience rather than assumptions. Remember to always consider context and avoid diagnosing based on limited information, instead suggest professional evaluation for a conclusive diagnosis.
