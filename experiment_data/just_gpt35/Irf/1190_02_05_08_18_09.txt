Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  today was really rough for me, as i've struggled with my gender identity for almost 2 years now. my boyfriend says that he'll love me no matter what, even if i decide i'm happier as a girl instead of a boy like i've convinced myself. we're both trans and afab, but i'm having my doubts. he told me today that he'd never leave me, but that only made my depression spiral back down. i've talked to him, and he told me all these coping mechanisms, but they never work. my one  coping mechanism  is having the knowledge of the thing i want to hurt myself with is within my reach. i have a utility knife that i wanna use for my own safety in college, but for now i really wanna cut myself with it. i'm scared to try and kms again, but when i tried to open up to my family about being trans, they tell me that i haven't given it enough thought and that i don't know what i want (i'm 17 and have known i hated being a girl since i hit puberty at 10). i don't wanna attempt again, but i'm desperate. i wanna be okay.
