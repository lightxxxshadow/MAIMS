Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Do you use nostalgia to escape the present or uncertainty of the future? I have been on a nostalgic trip for awhile and it makes me feel better, but then sad again when I come back to the present. I have had quite an uncertain year since graduating, so maybe it is that quarter-life crisis. Have you been through this phase?
