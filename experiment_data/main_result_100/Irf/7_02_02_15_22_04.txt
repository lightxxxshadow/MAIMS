Yes
The poster's responses to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 indicate that they perceive themselves as a burden, believe that people would be better off without them, and think that their death would be a relief to others. Additionally, they feel disconnected from other people, have few caring and supportive friends, and feel like an outsider in social gatherings. These feelings and thoughts suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
Ensure that you continue to ground your analysis in the clear evidence provided by the post and the individual's responses to the mental health scale. Avoid making assumptions that go beyond the information given, and remain cautious not to diagnose but rather to identify signs of distress or concerning thoughts that might warrant professional attention. Keep integrating specific details from the post and scale answers to support your conclusions, as you did well in this example.
