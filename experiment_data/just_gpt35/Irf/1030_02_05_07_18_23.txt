Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Maybe enjoy isnt the right word, but often i feel like im meant to be this way, and feeling any positive emotion is weird and unnatural. I think feeling this way has become my comfort zone I think im so far gone into this that now i dont even want any help. Ive rejected all suggestions for help from a professional, as that would mean i wouldn't feel depressed all the time, and thats unnatural and bad, i should just stick to what Im used to, and then eventually kill myself. Im rejecting anything that would lead to me not killing myself, so im doing my best to ensure i kill myself eventually, and thats whats causing a lot of the self sabotage im doing right now.

The post indicates a sense of isolation and not belonging, as well as a strong desire to reject help and continue feeling depressed. The mention of eventually wanting to kill oneself suggests a feeling of purposelessness and not finding meaning in life, which aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
