Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I don't know if it's the anxeity disorder or what, but lately I've been thinking for some reason that my life is gonna be short and end with a tragic and traumatic death. It's been kind of scaring me lately. I've also been having dreams about car crashes to the point I'm scared to drive farther than 5 minutes from my house. It may seem stupid but I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this before.

The post shows signs of perceived burdensomeness as the individual expresses thoughts of a tragic and traumatic death, fears related to driving, and seeks validation by asking if others have experienced something similar.
