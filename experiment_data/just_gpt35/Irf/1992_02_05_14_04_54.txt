Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Just been in a really bad place mentally I‚Äôm grateful for all the little things I have in my life. But the odds are stacked against me and I can‚Äôt even think straight or even focus in uni or even drive properly. Everyone else has a better life than me I know I should stop complaining and just try to make things better for myself but that‚Äôs so much easier being said than done. I‚Äôve tried everything but nothing has worked for me . I see the guy that my girlfriend cheated on me with he laughs right at my face just a spit on my face to show what a failure I am. Sorry for all the self loathing but I just have no one to talk to. Might just drive my car off the bridge tonight

The poster mentions feeling alone and not having anyone to talk to. They also express thoughts of driving their car off a bridge, which is a concerning sign of risk and despair. These feelings indicate a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as they perceive a lack of connection and support in their life.
