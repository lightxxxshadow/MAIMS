Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I've fucked up a lot. I've ruined every part of my life possible. I've dug this hole, and hit rock bottom, and there is literally no way to fix it. I know people will say it's all fixable, but trust me, it's not. There's too many things wrong. So it's like I -need- to do it because my life will not get better, and even if I want to hang on, there's no point.
