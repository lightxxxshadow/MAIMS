Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I usually didnt care anymore about how I look but I just had a breakdown because i am just ugly. And it's not one of those situations where I'm just saying, no, I'm genuinely ugly. People have called me ugly. I know what I see in the mirror and in photos. I am the farthest thing from physically (or socially) appealing and now I'm suicidal because I can't hang out with anyone anymore without wanting to die. I feel so embarrassed just by being present anywhere because of how hideous and cringy I am. I hate myself. There's no one I'm more disgusted at than myself. I look like a monster.

The poster expresses feelings of not fitting in and being socially rejected due to their perceived ugliness. They mention feeling embarrassed and cringing at their own presence, which suggests a sense of not belonging. The mention of suicidal ideation further emphasizes the high level of distress and sense of isolation that can be associated with thwarted belongingness.
