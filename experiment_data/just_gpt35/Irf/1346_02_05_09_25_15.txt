Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My boyfriend dumped me on Tuesday night. Yesterday afternoon I was really upset so I asked my ex boyfriend's best friend if we could hang out. We got coffee, talked and laughed about stuff and we made plans to hang out today. Yesterday night I was really upset so I asked him to come over. We got food and went back to my apartment. We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay. I just really wanted physical attention and love at that point so I kissed him and straddled him and we made out for a while. Today he came over and we just hung out and played cards and stuff. He said we should go for a drive which we did and then he wanted to show me his apartment. We went inside and he showed me around. We went into his room and he took his jacket off and we started kissing a lot. I laid in his bed and he got on top of me and we made out some more. He kept telling me how beautiful and gorgeous I am and eventually we had sex. Do you think I'm a whore?
