No
The poster's comment about accepting applications for a new bestie and jokingly saying 'lol' suggests a lighthearted tone and a sense of humor, which is not indicative of depression.

Correct
Your answer is correct; there's no clear evidence from the post to suggest that the poster is suffering from depression, and you've appropriately identified the humorous tone. However, be cautious about making any definitive judgements on mental health from limited information in a single social media post. Mental health assessments require a comprehensive understanding of an individual's emotions, thoughts, and behaviors over time.
