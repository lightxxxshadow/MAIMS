Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Only 7 cigarettes today This sounds really stupid but I’ve never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. I tried for the first time today to cut back and used my iPhone stop watch to try and wait 3 hours before another smoke. Drank tons and tons of water. Currently I have only had 6 today but I’m putting in the cautionary one more just in case I do before I go to bed. I dunno if it’s ok to be proud of yourself on Reddit but, that’s a cool Little win for the day in the mind of a depressive. Hope you all are fighting the good fight. Cheers EDIT: Jesus, I woke up to my inbox busting at the seams! Thanks for all the advice and kind words. Definitely going to continue the path today. Seems daunting to give up my smokes but cutting down got a lot easier with all of your support. Have a great day folks!

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's responses to the mental health scale indicate several symptoms of depression such as feeling sad much of the time, being more self-critical or blaming than usual, having less interest in other people or things, finding it difficult to make decisions, having less energy, being more irritable than usual, and experiencing a change in appetite. These factors suggest the presence of depressive symptoms and indicate a likelihood of depression.

Incorrect
Be cautious not to overinterpret or assume symptoms that have not been reported. Although the poster mentions feeling sad and other issues that could be indicative of depressive symptoms, they did not report a change in appetite, which has been mistakenly included in your analysis. Additionally, the poster reports that they are experiencing self-control regarding their smoking habit, which can be seen as a positive step and not necessarily a sign of depression. Focus on the information provided and avoid inferring beyond what is stated. Reassess the data and ensure your conclusions are based solely on the responses to the mental health scale and the content of the post. Match reported symptoms with the scale answers accurately and avoid assuming additional negative characteristics.

ITER 1
Yes
The poster's responses to the mental scale indicate feelings of sadness, self-criticism, restlessness, decreased interest in others, difficulty making decisions, decreased energy, increased irritability, and changes in sleep patterns. These symptoms align with criteria for depression.

Incorrect
Avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information. Though the poster expresses some characteristics associated with depressive symptoms, the claim regarding changes in sleep patterns was not supported by the poster's answers. Cross-verify each symptom reported with the answered questions. Be cautious not to infer symptoms that were not explicitly mentioned. Review the details in the self-report scale carefully to provide an evidence-based conclusion.

ITER 2
Yes
The poster's self-report scale responses indicate symptoms consistent with depression, such as feeling sad much of the time, being more self-critical than usual, having less energy, and being more irritable than usual.

Correct
While your analysis is correct in identifying symptoms of depression, such as sustained sadness and increased irritability, be careful not to overextend your inferences beyond the available data. Rely directly on the provided responses to relevant scale questions and ensure that each symptom you cite is supported by these responses. Continue seeking out multiple symptom indicators while avoiding assumptions, especially when discussing mental health, where nuanced understanding is crucial.
