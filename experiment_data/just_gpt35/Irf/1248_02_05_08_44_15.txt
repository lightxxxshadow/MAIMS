True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Recently made a post about how I was going to stop self harming it's now 12:45 no one has wished me a happy new year not my parents or the freinds I believed cared about me. This has just showed me that no one truly cares and I'm about ready to give up I have spent the last year when I was at my worst making sure that I made the people I work with happy and when I needed help the most I have been forgotten by everyone I have never been so upset and let down I no longer care about faking a smile fuck everything
