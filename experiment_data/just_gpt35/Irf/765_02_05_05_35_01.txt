Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Nothing, everything I tried dedicating myself into always made me realize how pathetic and useless I am. Whenever I try helping someone in something things go worse or I am completely useless. I always spend most of my time in my computer doing nothing but being useless all day playing games or browsing reddit to then feel like a piece of shit at night. Whenever there's the opportunity to socialize or go out of my town I reject it because I feel a bit anxious at first or feel really lazy. All the goals I set for myself always end broken because of a lack of motivation or straight up laziness. That's just me, nothing but a waste of space and a burden to everyone around me, that is also the embodiment of laziness

The post indicates a strong feeling of worthlessness, being a burden to others, and a belief that the poster is useless and unproductive. These thoughts align with the concept of perceived burdensomeness, which is a risk factor for mental health problems like depression and suicidal ideation.
