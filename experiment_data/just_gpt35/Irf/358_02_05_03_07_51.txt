Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I wanna ask you because for some time now I've been trying to be less cynical and do stuff other people like but I just cannot understand why are they doing all of this? I hate facebook , I hate memes ,I hate internet culture and it annoys me to see people embracing it and not even being able to make a normal conversation just talk about memes on the internet , stupid youtube videos and shows that they binge watch in a day and don't have any valueable opinion on it just saying that they liked it or not . Am I just a cynical cunt ? PS: By the way I'm posting this qustion here because this stuff is quite a big reason of my lolieness and depression , you know I just can't find anybody to connect with and it's not like I automaticly cross the person off for liking this stuff , I'm trying to get to know them and it turns out that they're just a frankenstein of all the popculture they absorbed and they cannot hold a conversation even for a little while.
