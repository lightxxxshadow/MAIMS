Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Mindless Self Indulgence - It Gets Worst comes to mind immediately. This song is pretty much my theme song. I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot. Behemoth, Shade Empire, Dimmu Borgir, Hate. Great bands. Since I am usually not happy, I rather sit and listen to music that is about death, destruction, hatred, pain, misanthorpy, war, and satanism. All the dark shit. I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace. It fits in with usually how I feel. If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless. Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place. I should have my vocal cords removed. I thought I would be happier because I got a better job, but being lonely really sucks a lot more than I thought it would.

The post reflects a sense of isolation, negative self-perception, and a desire to remove themselves from social situations. These are indicators of perceived burdensomeness, which suggests a potential risk.
