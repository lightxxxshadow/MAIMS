The post suggests isolating oneself, which can be a sign of perceived burdensomeness. Perceived burdensomeness refers to feeling like a burden on others, leading to social withdrawal and avoidance of social interactions. Isolating oneself can be an indication that the individual sees themselves as burdensome and may be experiencing feelings of low self-worth or depressive symptoms.
