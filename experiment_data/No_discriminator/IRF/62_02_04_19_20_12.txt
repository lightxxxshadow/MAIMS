Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hi I don't know what the hell is going on. Today I have woken up becouse of my phone clock. I turn first of them off and went to sleep again. I'm always set few clocks to have 100% chance of woke up. After 3 clocks I turn every single one off. I don't wanna get up. I wanna just lie in my bed for all day but after few minutes i get up. I feel extremely stressed and bad. I don't have any tests today and anything that could stress me so what the hell? Why am I feeling this way? When i'm in school nothing bad I think that would happen happened but I still feel bad. Even through ppl talk to me, nothing bad happen I feel worse and worse. Then I have suicide thoughts. Realy big. Actually I may do this, there are so big if they haven't ended after some time. They and bad mood ended when I have nice conversation with friend about makeing cover of Sepultura song. I suddenly stop feel bad and feel happy for few minutes. The thoughts ended but after I came back to my house, when I'm alone I feel bad again. What the hell is happening to me? Someone on /r/suicidewatch write that I may suffer from depression. What are you thinking about this?
