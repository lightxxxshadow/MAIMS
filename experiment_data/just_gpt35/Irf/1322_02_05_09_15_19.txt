The post expresses a strong desire for connection and belonging, as evident from the repeated mention of wanting friends and not wanting to be alone. The use of words like 'hell' and 'pain' also imply a high level of distress and emotional suffering. These feelings of isolation and desperation suggest a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological construct associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
