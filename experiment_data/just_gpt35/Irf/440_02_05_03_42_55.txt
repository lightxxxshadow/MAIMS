Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  i had some old roomates that i thought were friends that screwed me out of alot of money and stiffed me with a ton of dept and i managed to get an ok job and blew it somehow, got let go the month before i woulda been able to make any real change toward looming bills and collection calls. i had good reviews and was told i was efficient and trusted so it hit me so far outta left field. i lost it as i had so much banking on this job thought people liked me, thought i was stable for once ... i tried to pull myself back up but then i got hurt, broke my jaw and then my jaw got infected and i was hospitalized; severe fever, pain, all the fun times. they had to remove a good portion of my teeth and im only my 30s and now i dont have medical coverage anymore. with no income i cant afford medication or the ambulance bill and someone smashes into my car (im ok) but why now! i finally get unemployment insurance and it only barely covers rent, guess food is optional. i went from being able to afford meals to food banks/food stamps. i had to get rid of my pets cause i cant feed them, that hurt more than anyone should ever have to... and then he got sick and died anyway. I'm having so much trouble trying to get new job to distract myself, I'm begging to think I'm un-hirable after days weeks without phone calls. i cant afford my phone anymore, my rents paid but my bills come out couple days i have -10 dollars. i get no funds/NSF fees for 2018, happy new year? i tried.

The post indicates a sense of isolation and lack of belonging, as the poster discusses being screwed over by friends, losing a job unexpectedly, having financial difficulties, being hospitalized and losing medical coverage, and being unable to afford basic necessities. These experiences can contribute to a feeling of thwarted belongingness.
