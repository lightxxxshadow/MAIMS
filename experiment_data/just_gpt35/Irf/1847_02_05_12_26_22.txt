Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  If you guys want the story as to why, there's an earlier post I made about my story. Though not hugely dramatic, it is too much for me to bear. What should I do? I hate myself, I don't have friends anymore and I hate my life. I've just thought about taking a loaded shotgun and ending things just like that, but... I'm afraid to die. What do I do?
