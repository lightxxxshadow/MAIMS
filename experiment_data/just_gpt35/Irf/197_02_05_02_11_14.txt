Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I know i dont know you but i do know what you are going through. I know every morning hurts. Everyday another struggle towards the goal of no longer existing. Everyday wanting it to be over finally. I hope you keep fighting though. I hope you keep trying to live And Not living only because you dont want your death to hurt people but truly living because you want to be alive. Im not there yet and I might never be but i am going to try to keep up hope that i do. Anyone going through as much as we are deserves love and even if there is no one else there that says it know that people care. Every suicide i hurts a little because i know it could be me. I hope i don't see your name this year.
