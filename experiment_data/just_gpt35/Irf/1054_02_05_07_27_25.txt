Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've never written on reddit before. I'm not sure what I'm expecting from doing this. I guess a feeling of release. I've been suppressing my feelings to put on a show for everyone else. That despite this year bringing me the hardest time of my life, I'm being strong, I'm being resilient. But the truth is I'm not. When I interact with people, I'm the bubbly, smiley persona that is expected of me. But as soon as I'm alone, my face is blank, my emotions are numb and all of the feelings I'm pushing down resurface. My expression completely changes when I'm alone. Im a different person. A person no one knows. But the facade is starting to fall apart. I dont want to do this anymore but no one cares about the girl behind the mask..
