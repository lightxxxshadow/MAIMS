Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I come from and live in a country where things are too hard and over half the population is unemployed and suffering mentally. The only people surviving are doing something illegal like pulling the most scams, kidnapping or prostitution. I wish I can indulge in any of this, I have tried to do everything legally even with a degree i seem not to find a job. It is too hard for me to live on, I can‚Äôt afford basic meal or rent and this hardship has set even my family apart. I am thinking of taking my life as the problem persist. See you guys on the other side if ever succeed.

The post indicates a sense of social isolation and disconnection from others, as the poster mentions that their family has been set apart and they feel unable to afford basic needs. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological state characterized by a lack of satisfying and meaningful social connections.
