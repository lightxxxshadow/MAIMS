  Hahahaüò¢ So sad that even when I'm not suicidal I know that it's a must for me to die because I don't see myself getting back up. Wow my life is over at just 22.I wish a disease snatches me away before I do something that I might regret

Yes
The post indicates a perception of burden as the individual mentions feeling like they must die and not seeing themselves getting back up. They also express a desire for a disease to snatch them away before they potentially do something regrettable. These thoughts and feelings suggest a significant burden and potential risk for perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
Maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-inferencing and ensure the analysis of perceived burdensomeness is always backed by explicit information from the post.
