Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've fucked up a lot. I've ruined every part of my life possible. I've dug this hole, and hit rock bottom, and there is literally no way to fix it. I know people will say it's all fixable, but trust me, it's not. There's too many things wrong. So it's like I -need- to do it because my life will not get better, and even if I want to hang on, there's no point.

The post suggests that the person believes they have ruined every aspect of their life and that there is no way to fix it. They express a need to do something potentially harmful because they feel their life will not get better and there is no point in hanging on. This demonstrates a risk of perceived burdensomeness, as they feel hopeless and believe they are a burden to others.
