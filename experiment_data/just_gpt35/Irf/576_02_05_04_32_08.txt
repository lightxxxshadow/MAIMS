Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I never thought that one day I'd ever be depressed or start having depressing thoughts, but here I am. I feel like I'm failing at everything. I don't think anybody in particular is causing it. I just feel like I don't deserve anything good that happens to me and that I'll never be good enough for my family or friends. I feel guilty since on paper, it seems like I wouldn't be so depressed. My family's alright, my girlfriend's great, and I have good friends, but I feel like I don't deserve any of it and that I'm only holding them back. I know that I sound like a whining bitch right now since I say that I have all these people who can help me, but I feel guilty for making them worry and for being depressed in the first place. Every time I feel depressed, I start thinking that I shouldn't be, and that only makes me feel worse.
