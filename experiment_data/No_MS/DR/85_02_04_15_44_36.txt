Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  is there a comfort in sadness? my therapist, my psychiatrist, and my parents all say i’m “so much better” than i used to be. and i am. i know that. i don’t even think about suicide anymore and i haven’t self harmed in a few years. but my brain is still fucked up and it always will be. i can live with that. but not when all these people around me are telling me how happy i am. just because i’m better than i was a few years ago doesn’t mean i’m good. i’m better by comparison. but that’s it. and i hate being told how “great” i’m doing. but then i think maybe i’m just overreacting to the word “happy” because i’m more comfortable being sad. i’ve been sad for so long that there’s a certain comfort in it. sad is familiar. happy is unknown and risky. can anyone relate to this or am i alone?

Yes
The poster displays symptoms of depression, such as feeling sad, having a negative view of oneself, and feeling a certain comfort in sadness. The mention of previous suicide ideation and self-harm also suggests a history of depression.

Correct
Ensure you always distinguish between past and present symptoms, acknowledging any progress made. While it is appropriate to consider the history of self-harm and suicidal ideation when assessing for depression, also pay attention to current feelings and functioning. Continue to practice cautious appraisal without overgeneralizing or assuming inherent negative traits that are not explicitly mentioned.
