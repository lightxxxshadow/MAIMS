Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  As the title says, I cut myself for the first time yesterday. It was only 2 swipes, but it feels like a huge step back and I don't know what to do. I don't have a therapist and I can't talk to my parents about it because they think its not as serious as it is. I just don't know where to go from here.

The post indicates a lack of support and understanding from the poster's parents and the absence of a therapist. This suggests a potential lack of social connections and a risk of thwarted belongingness.
