Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I still remember that image of you and him so close together in that hallway alone. It burned itself into my mind. I get it though. I wasn't as athletic or good looking as him, nor was I popular. My grades were slightly below average, so that didn't help as much. I know my situation before and now isn't your fault at all, but my whole experience with you was just terrible. I tried to look at the brighter side of things before. So, from what I've learned: 1. Don't get close to anyone that fast 2. She doesn't have any interest in you 3. When faced with a difficult emotion, think of nothing and it will soon go away. Side effects may include lack of emotion of practised long enough.

The post indicates feelings of inadequacy and comparing oneself unfavorably to others, which can contribute to a sense of burden on others. The mention of 'terrible' experience and trying to avoid difficult emotions also suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.
