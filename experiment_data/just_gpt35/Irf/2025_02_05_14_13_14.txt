Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  what‚Äôs the point? why even try? all that i learned from this mess called ‚Äúlife‚Äù is that there is no point in trying, life gets harder and harder every single day to lead up to what? more hard work and stress to get us to nothing in the end. we humans work our asses off 24/7 for fucking jackshit. excuse me for my profanity here but i‚Äôm being serious, what actually is the point of this torturous cycle called ‚Äúlife‚Äù? all i‚Äôm willing to do right now is jump off an overpass because i can‚Äôt do it all over again...

The post indicates feelings of hopelessness, lack of motivation, and a desire to escape life. The mention of wanting to jump off an overpass suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness and a feeling of being overwhelmed by the difficulties and stresses of life.
