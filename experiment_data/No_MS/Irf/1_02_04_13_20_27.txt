Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  [I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences] I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety. For the first week I was prescribed 5mg, 10mg thereafter. It's been two days and I have this mild feeling like I'm on ecstasy/MDMA. My body feels light and I have this weird concentration of energy above my neck at the back of my head. Has anyone felt this/experienced this?

The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness. It seems to be an inquiry about a specific experience related to medication side effects.

Correct
Good job on not over-inferencing. When answering similar questions, continue to focus on what is explicitly stated in the post, avoiding assumptions about the poster's characteristics that aren't supported by the provided information.
