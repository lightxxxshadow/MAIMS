Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I want to feel like I belong here. I wish there were people whom I could connect with. Unfortunately, I don't know where life is taking me right now. I'm too tired of the everyday grind. Life has become a constant struggle. I wish this agony would end. I've been hoping for a long time. I thought I had people by my side. There are people who care but I don't know why I'm not able to connect with them. I just feel empty. :( I've endured for a long time. I just wish this would end some day.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post suggests feelings of being a burden on others, thinking that their death would be a relief to others, and feeling disconnected and unable to connect with people. These thoughts and emotions indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which can be a symptom of a mental health problem such as depression or social anxiety.

Incorrect
Be careful to not infer emotions or thoughts that the poster did not express directly. While the individual feels disconnected and struggles with a sense of belonging, their responses to the scale questions, specifically Question ID of 2, 3, 4, and 5 indicate they do not view themselves as a burden to others or believe their death would be a relief to people in their life. Focus on the explicit content of both the post and the scale answers to avoid over-inference and to accurately represent the poster's self-perceived mental state.

ITER 1
No
The individual does not view themselves as a burden to others or believe their death would be a relief to people in their life based on their responses to the scale questions.

Incorrect
Review the answered questions on the mental health scale again, focusing on the feelings of connection and burdensomeness indicated. Questions 7 and 13 suggest a lack of belonging and support, while Question 6 indicates a belief that others do not care, implying an emotional burden. The feeling of being a burden is also supported in the post. Pay close attention to nuanced expressions of perceived burdensomeness in both the self-report scale and the post content.

ITER 2
Yes
The post indicates feelings of isolation, disconnection, and a lack of belonging. These feelings are consistent with the respondent's answers to questions 7, 13, and 6 on the mental health scale, which suggest a lack of support, a lack of people to turn to in times of need, and a belief that others do not care. The poster also expresses a desire for the agony to end and mentions feeling like a burden. All these factors suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
Keep aligning responses on mental health scales with the content of the posts to assess the person's feelings accurately. Avoid over-generalizing or inferring beyond what the information suggests.
