True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm ending 2016 having to fight through a situation I have no energy to deal with. I am being victimised once more and have little hope of getting help, yet I have no choice but to fight. I feel so much despair and anguish, and the NYE celebrations going on around me only make it worse. I honestly don't know if I can live through to the new year. God or someone help me.
