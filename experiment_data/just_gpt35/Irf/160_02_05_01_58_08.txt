Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm lost... I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't control my emotions anymore. I'm pissed one second and crying the next, I'm laughing now and want to end it 5 seconds later. I've tried all my tricks to help and nothing. I'm so depressed lately with everything happening in my life from work to personal to legal. I always feel so alone... I seriously just want to end it lately. I don't want to go on anymore, it's to damn hard and I'm sick and tired of living a life full of torture. üòî
