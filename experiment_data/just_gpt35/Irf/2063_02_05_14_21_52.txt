Yes
The post indicates feelings of unworthiness, self-hatred, and a negative view of life. The statement 'nobody fucking cares' suggests a perceived lack of support or belonging. The expression of anger towards the human race and life itself may reflect a sense of hopelessness and despair, which can be indicative of perceived burdensomeness.
