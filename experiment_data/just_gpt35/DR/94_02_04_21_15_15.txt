Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Just found out my mum is pregnant. Advice on big age gaps between siblings would be appreciated. I have two younger sisters, and we're all really close in age (my youngest sister is 3 years younger than me), but I'm turning 20 this year. So this new baby will be 20 years younger than me. I'm not sure how to feel. My sisters and I are fairly close, and I'm worried that we won't be able to bond with our new sibling because of the huge age difference. We'll probably have all moved out in a few years (I've been planning on moving out this year) so we won't even get to have time to make those connections like we did with each other. It's just that it doesn't even feel real to me yet. Like if I was told that a relative or family friend was pregnant, not my own mother. If anyone has any advice or experience with something like this I would be really grateful to hear it. Thank you.

The poster is expressing worry and uncertainty about the age gap between themselves and the new sibling, which is a normal emotional response. This does not indicate a specific mental health problem such as depression. However, further assessment would be necessary to confirm if the poster is experiencing any mental health issues.
