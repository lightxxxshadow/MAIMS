True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Anybody feel like they just don't have anybody to just talk to? Sure I have parents and my two siblings, but I feel like im not close enough with any of them to share anything. Same with friends, I have a lot, but I don't have that one friend or a best friend. I just started talking to this girl 2 months ago, but I don't want to pile her with my thoughts.
