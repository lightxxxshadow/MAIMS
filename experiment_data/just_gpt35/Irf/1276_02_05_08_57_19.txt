Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I recently opened up to a family member that I take 2 medications for my depression (and for anxiety &amp; PTSD), and I have trouble explaining how they work for me, and how I feel/think/am with and without them. I'm pretty much the same person to other people with or without the meds, but inside, the medication makes me feel more like I'm in the world/less vegetative and a lot less anxious. Do you have tips on how to explain depression or what you have told people?

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. The individual is seeking advice on how to explain depression and their experience with medication to others, indicating a desire for understanding and connection rather than a lack of belongingness.
