No
The responses to the questions related to perceived burdensomeness (Q1, Q2, Q4, Q6) do not indicate any significant risk. The poster does not express feelings of being a burden or that the people in their life would be better off without them. Therefore, the risk of perceived burdensomeness is not evident in the post.

Correct
Continue to carefully distinguish between the poster's own feelings and the assumptions about others. Maintain your focus on the available evidence when assessing risk factors like perceived burdensomeness, and avoid over-inference without clear information backing it.
