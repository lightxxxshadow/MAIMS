True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm not sure which is worse: to be completely physically alone or mentally alone despite there being physical presence. Although I don't have to pretend to be mentally okay when I'm on my own.

The post suggests a feeling of disconnect and loneliness, both physically and mentally. The mention of being mentally alone despite physical presence indicates a lack of emotional connection and potential feelings of isolation. This aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness, which is characterized by a sense of being disconnected from others and experiencing a lack of belongingness.
