Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  In this world full of wifi connection, human connection seems obsolete. I feel so alone. It's a cliche feeling, I know. Me against the world and nobody is on my side. The world is winning, etc. But I just feel so down. So so so depressed. I told myself that this 2018 I will embrace what is real - real people, real words, real friends. And then I realized everyone around me is fake. I envy those people who have friends who stick with them whatever happens. I wonder if I could still find real friends nowadays. Just one real friend would be nice. Just so I don't feel this way anymore. Some will say this too shall pass but it has been weeks and it ain't done yet.

Yes
The post indicates feelings of isolation and loneliness, as well as a desire for real connections with others. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the poster may feel like a burden to others or that others would not understand or support them.

Reassess the notion of perceived burdensomeness; it's distinct from loneliness. Avoid inferring perceived burdensomeness without explicit signs of self-viewed burden on others.
