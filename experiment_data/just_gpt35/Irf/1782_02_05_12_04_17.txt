Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing. Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma. Half of me keeps slapping my weak and fragile other half, but I'm not making any steps forward.

These feelings and thoughts are indicative of thwarted belongingness, where the individual feels disconnected and unable to find a sense of belonging or support from others.
