Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Today is my 45th birthday. Today is my 45th birthday. Being 45 doesn't bug me as much as the lack of accomplishments and life lived in those years. I've spent the last 20 years lost in depression. I'm tired, hopeless, ashamed, and emotionally defeated. I go to bed scared and wake up disappointed. People ask if I am suicidal, and my answer is,  I'm open to the possibility.  People ask if I'm planning, and I say,  No, not actively. I've already planned it out.  I can't understand why I am still here nor do I understand why I stay.
