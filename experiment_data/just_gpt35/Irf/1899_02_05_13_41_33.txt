Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  1 month ago I was considering suicide. I talked to my primary care physician and told them how I was feeling and what I was thinking. They put me into a group therapy program and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I can honestly say it saved my life. I cannot express how helpful this was for me and I urge you all to talk to someone. There is hope for us all and people willing to listen. It‚Äôs the new year and the perfect time for a change.
