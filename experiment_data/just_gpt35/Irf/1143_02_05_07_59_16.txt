Post:
  Besides the fact that a lot of people i considered friends didnt even remember , now i have reached extremes levels of my anxiety because i have to invite friends over for a party otherwise they'll think im weird or i dont want to hang out with them. I dont enjoy parties mainly cause i'm poor and i cant organise one properly , also i just have high anxiety when too many people are around me. I dont want to lose the last friends i have but i dont know what to do. sorry if this post doesnt fit or whatever i just wanted to express whats on my mind thank you for your attention. also sorry for the bad english

The post suggests that the individual is experiencing anxiety due to the fear of being perceived as weird or not wanting to hang out with friends. This fear could stem from a belief that they are a burden to others, leading to perceived burdensomeness.
