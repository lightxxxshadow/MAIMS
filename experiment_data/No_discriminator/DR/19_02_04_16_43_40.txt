Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Should I meet estranged grandfather? I've never met my grandfather due to him and my grandmother being divorced, and my mother being the  least favorite  wants nothing to do with him. However her siblings are super close to him and my cousins have known him their whole lives. I'm not aware of any physical abuse that happened but I know verbal towards my mother and grandmother and their appearances and capabilities occurred as well as blaming my mother for the divorce. He has attempted to apologize to my mother for years and sends her cards which she throws away or returns. If physical occurred I would not want to meet him and I'm wondering if my mother is acting the way she is because she's hiding something. Also he has never reached out to me but my aunts say he asks about me regularly. He may have not reached out due to the fact my mother won't speak to him. But part of me doesn't want to care if he's not willing to reach out. I'm torn.... Any advice?
