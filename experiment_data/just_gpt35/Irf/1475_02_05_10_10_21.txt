Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I've tried getting help, but nothing lasts long enough. I thought meds were doing the work they told me it would, but still here I am paralyzed with no desire to do anything. I just want motivation or reason to not waste all this time I have. I feel bad for everyone that deals with me, because more often than not they think I hate them, and that just makes me hate myself even more. I don't know how to live with others, or how anyone does it. It feels like boredom, but I know I can't help it. I just wish I could fix it.
