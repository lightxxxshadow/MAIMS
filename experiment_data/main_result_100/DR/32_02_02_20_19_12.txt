Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've been having suicidal thoughts more than ever... I feel like I fail at everything, I don't have any motivation to clean or really do anything. I feel like I'm no good at anything and have gotten really lazy. I'm not the best wife and I've made many mistakes. If i asked my husband to do something and he didn't I'd complain to try and get help. If he's not doing anything I wouldn't either. Now that he's moved out I feel like I don't really have any reason to live. I used to smoke weed but had to stop a little under a month ago cause I got arrested (on my anniversary) and am facing felony charges on something that's legal. I've had to hire a lawyer and everything to try to keep my record clean. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was in high school and kind of turned smoking a bowl into my medicine so I would always refuse depression meds. I've heard mixed things about them, and I'm scared on how they would take effect on me. But since the arrest I've been getting progressively worse and worse. My husband was the one who initially got me to quit hurting myself and the thoughts keep haunting me more than ever. One of the biggest reasons I haven't been able to bring myself to doing it again is I care for others more than myself. I couldn't hurt my friends and family like that but I'm mentally going insane...

Yes
The poster's symptoms align with several indicators of depression, such as feeling sad much of the time, being discouraged about the future, experiencing past failures, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, self-dislike, self-accusations, suicidal thoughts or wishes, crying more than usual, loss of interest, worthlessness, loss of energy, irritability, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, and tiredness or fatigue.

Correct
Ensure that each symptom identified is directly supported by the post content and the answers from the mental health scale. Be cautious not to infer any details that are not explicitly stated or suggested by the evidence provided.
