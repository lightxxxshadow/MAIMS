Yes
The post shows a risk of perceived burdensomeness based on the answers to the mental scale questions. The poster expresses feelings of being a burden on society, thinking their death would be a relief to others, and believing they make things worse for people in their life. They also feel disconnected from others, rarely interact with people who care about them, and do not feel a sense of belonging or close relationships. These factors indicate a high risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
