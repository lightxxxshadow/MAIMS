Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Longtime close friend, brand-new bewilderment My friend is distractable. He thinks irrationally. And he barely listens anymore. I feel as though I've become a pane of glass or a mirror to him. When we're in a car together, he drones on about things (tell me if this has happened to you) he's told me many times before. Occasionally, in the middle, there's an admission:  I probly told you this before, but.. . However, the story always continues, even if I briefly recap the story for him. When it's obvious the information has been shared, the most pressing imperative seems to be on reiterating it. Perhaps I didn't give the desired response the first time. I get the feeling he just doesn't care whether I'd like to hear it. I also possess conversational preferences, and they never include hearing the same story twice. After countless reccurences of this scenario, it seems that my considerations aren't really valued or remembered. Mentally, he seems to be on a train and passengers (myself included) are always bustling through and, as such, might just seem replaceable. There doesn't seem anymore to be a genuine interest in my take on things. Questions are rarely asked, and if they are, they're poised in such a way as to elicit some agreeable response. We've never had a problem with differing opinions, but lately there is a marked disinterest in mine. If I express perhaps a different perspective I might share on something, he's typically halfway through deconstructing it and preparing a rebuttal by the time I've reached the bulk of my first sentence. Lately, I make sure to be concise. 10-word sentences. Brief, clear declarations with stipulations kept to a minimum. I do this in a sincere effort to make sure at least some of my thoughts reach him via this channel called speech. I feel a little like a sidekick, implicitly expected to go along with whatever is said or suggested and quietly supporting. I have needs and I make sure they're met. I just make sure, now, that they're met completely before I go into a conversation or endeavor with him. The attention span has completely plummeted. He and his phone might as well have fused into one entity. Often times, when we're driving somewhere, or at our shared place of work, he will open a conversation. What he desires to be communicated is seemingly achieved. I give plenty of time, listening quietly and waiting a few seconds before responding. When I respond, sometimes I'll be surprised that I've been able to speak for a couple of sentences without being interrupted. Then, I'll look up and almost invariably, he's on his phone texting, on social media, or looking at boobs. I fall silent and look at him, stopping my speech, and sometimes there's a feigned response that hazily resembles some degree of mental assimilation. Other times, my input is simply ignored. I feel often that I am relegated to silence by virtue of necessity. What is the point of talking or even attempting to share with someone if they feel their device is more important than you? When there is no device involved, the listening is of such low quality that I feel as though I'm viewed as a shadow, or some reflective panel that occasionally flashes some piece of light which sparks a brief reaction. I use the word reaction explicitly to differentiate from response. Responding, to me, would be careful consideration of the texture of the exchange. What I see falls on a spectrum between bristling and hyperenthusiastic. Everything in the observable behavior appears to come from an emotionally fueled place. I long ago ceased trying to appeal to logic and reason, because there seems to be a fantasy aspect to his formulations about reality, business, and essentially learning in general. An obstinate and vigorous type of chauvinism appears when the discussion involves logically based and scientifically supported criterion as pillars of discussion.  Have you ever thought that maybe our ideas about science are just implanted by society, and another race has fully influenced our evolution as human beings?  (to imply that the scrutiny intrinsic to the scientific community's assimilation of data is too dismissive toward fringe and pseudoscientific contributions).  Physics is just one way to understand reality; there are physics we aren't even aware of that we won't know about for hundreds of years  (as a soft excuse
