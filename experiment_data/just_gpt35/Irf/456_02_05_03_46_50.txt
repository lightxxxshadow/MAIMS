The post indicates that the individual feels a lack of belongingness or a sense of social isolation. They mention having fake friends, a small family, and recently losing their mother. Additionally, they express feeling used to the negative experiences in their life and have lost the energy to live. The fear of hurting two or three people further suggests a desire for connection and belongingness, albeit in a somewhat strained manner.
