True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I hate myself. Because of one stupid mistake - I could have just ruined my future career. My dream career. All because I didn't hand in my report on time. I want to fucking end it all. My parents are gonna berate me. I just wanna jump off the balcony of my school and say  All you have caused is pain and suffering . I'm gonna be stuck working at McDonald's. I SPENT OVER 150 HOURS ON THIS REPORT TO FAIL AT THE SIMPLEST THING.

The poster expressed feelings of self-hatred and a desire to end their life due to a mistake they made, fearing that it will ruin their future career. This indicates a sense of isolation and a lack of belongingness, as they anticipate negative reactions from their parents and anticipate being stuck in a low-paying job at McDonald's.
