The post suggests that the person is feeling alone, lonely, and depressed, and believes that others are having a better time than them. They propose having a party to alleviate these feelings and make themselves feel less alone. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as they may believe that their presence or participation might burden or bother others, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.
