Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I always enjoy having non serious debates with people because it is a good way to understand how people think. When I was having the debate with my friend, my friend's argument was not clear, so I kept questioning, but she gave me the same answer over and over again. We decided to just end it because it was going no where. I later said (texted),  we should continue tomorrow, it was fun.  I still had things to say but just wanted to come off as fun and light-hearted so that this debate will go on. She started attacking the way I'm acting and my personality ( which was related to the argument ) and said I started getting angry when she started aggressively texted me. She has a tendency to purposely anger me many times, however sometimes she takes it too far and doesn't realizes. I even told her after that I didn't like when she did it but she still acted like a sarcastic asshole to me. It just made me really angry and annoyed and I just feel like punching something or inflict pain on myself to feel better. 4Am I overreacting? Edit: I suffer from depression and my mood sometimes get very affected drastically. So I was just wondering if it is common to feel this way.
