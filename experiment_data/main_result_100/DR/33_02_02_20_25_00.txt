Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Possessive friends Hi there, this is my first post. I became friends with a girl from my new class this year (who i had never met until we came into the same class) and became good friends with each other.She has a big network of friends and is quite different from me(talks to everyone, likes everyone, an extrovert). One day, a boy who happens to be her best friend saw us talking and got angry(for the life of me, i do not know why) and started making fake rumors about me, which she blindly believed. when she came to confront me about these false allegations, i flipped out and got quite angry and i have not talked to her for 3 days. Her friends are determined to hate me for some unknown reason and at the same time the girl has to problem with this, even defending them, saying that they are just very possessive of her. I am in a dilemma on what to do, ignore the hate or to stop caring and ignore her.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
No
The poster does not exhibit significant symptoms of depression based on the provided answers to the mental scale questions. Although the poster seems to be experiencing negative emotions such as anger and disappointment, these emotions alone do not indicate depression. Additionally, the absence of symptoms such as sadness, pessimism, guilt feelings, self-accusations, and changes in sleeping pattern suggest that depression may not be the primary mental health problem in this case.

Incorrect
Review the answered questions carefully before concluding. The individual does express feelings of sadness and disappointment in themselves, as well as signs of irritability, restlessness, and lower energy levels. These symptoms can be indicative of depression and should not be overlooked. To improve, crosscheck the mental health scales with the post details, and consider the context and frequency of reported symptoms. Be cautious not to under infer or dismiss symptoms simply because some typical depression markers are absent. Approach your analysis with a balanced view, considering both the presence and absence of symptoms holistically.

ITER 1
Yes
The poster expresses feelings of sadness, disappointment in themselves, irritability, restlessness, and lower energy levels, which are indicative of depression.

Incorrect
Avoid overgeneralizing based on a few symptoms. Consider each symptom's context and duration, and whether they significantly impair daily functioning, as required by DSM criteria for a depression diagnosis. Assess if the poster has been experiencing these symptoms consistently for at least two weeks. Additionally, verify that the symptoms and the feelings described are directly from the poster, rather than inferred or about others.

ITER 2
No
The poster's responses to the mental scale questions do not indicate significant symptoms of depression. While the poster expresses feelings of disappointment in themselves, restlessness, irritability, and decreased energy, these symptoms may be attributed to the current situation with their possessive friend rather than a depressive episode. It is important to consider the duration, consistency, and impairment caused by these symptoms when assessing for depression, and in this case, the symptoms do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression.

Correct
The student's analysis appears appropriate, as there is no indication from the responses to the mental health scale that the poster meets the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. Remember to evaluate each symptom in the context of the individual's life events and duration of the symptoms. Avoid diagnosing based on a single situation and ensure to gather information about how these symptoms affect the individual's daily functioning before coming to a conclusion.
