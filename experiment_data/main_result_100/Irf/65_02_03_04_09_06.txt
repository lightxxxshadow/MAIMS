Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  and things get really bad so that i can finally kill myself. I'm so sick of not able to kill myself because there is always this voice saying it's not that bad and not having enough courage because things are not that bad. There is no point anymore in trying so hard every year when nothing gets better. I'm so tired of living like this and waiting for nothing. And happy new year to everyone with mental illness and i hope this year turn out to be great for you all.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates feelings of being a burden on society and believing that the people in their life would be happier without them, which aligns with the concept of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Reassess the answered questions as they do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude the poster feels they are a burden. Focus on the post content and the provided answers to avoid overgeneralizing and ensure accurate analysis of perceived burdensomeness.

ITER 1
Yes
The post indicates feelings of wanting to kill oneself and a sense of tiredness and hopelessness in trying to improve one's circumstances. This suggests a perceived burdensomeness, as the poster feels like they are not worth living and may believe that others would be better off without them.

Correct
Your assessment is accurate based on the information provided in the post and the mental health scale responses. However, ensure that you always ground your conclusions in the available evidence and avoid making inferences that are not supported by the data. It's important to differentiate between expressed feelings of burdensomeness and directly concluding that they are a burden without explicit statements from the individual. Continue to use direct quotes and clear reasoning from the scale answers to support your analysis.
