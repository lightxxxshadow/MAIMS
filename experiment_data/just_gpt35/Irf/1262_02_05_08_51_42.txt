Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Throwaway account because this is fucking embarrassing and I don't want it on my real account. I was just chilling watching rogue one, drinking a beer when I kept seeing my self squeezing the glass so hard it shatters in my hand. It was like a clip playing on a loop, I had to set the glass down because I was afraid I'd actually do it. Now I can't stop thinking about self harming, which I haven't done since I was 15, that was 8 years ago. I can't distract myself from these thoughts anymore, I know I'm going relapse into my eating disorder and I'm just fucking exhausted with this. Happy new year y'all.

The post describes feeling isolated and embarrassed, which can indicate a lack of belongingness. The mention of self-harming thoughts and fear of relapse into an eating disorder further suggests a disconnection from others and feelings of being misunderstood or unsupported.
