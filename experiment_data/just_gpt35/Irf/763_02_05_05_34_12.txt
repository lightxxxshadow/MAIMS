Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  This has not been a good year for me, and has not been for a great amount of people, there is a great stigma towards 2016 as being a shitty year, but how many people actually lost something this year? Yeah celebrities died, blah blah, I'm not being apathetic, they were good people, but how many people actually cared about them? Every single time some big name dies, people fill their facebook statuses talking about how x was a big inspiration for them, how x helped them greatly, thing is, most people didn't give a flying fuck about them in the first place, but virality hit them and they didn't want to feel left out of it, facebook is nothing but a big viral circus for the ego, pseudo friends and ads. I'm tired of being told my depression is chemical inbalance or some other bs, I love life, but I'm tired of being pointed as the culprit because for sure I'm trying, how many times I messaged facebook  friends  and they were downer as fuck, only replying with fillers or excuses, nobody wants to hang out, most people don't want to really connect anymore, they want to live out their digital identities in real life, real socialization is basically dead, everyone is racing towards who's got the  better  social condition, who's got more likes? who's got more photos? I'm not exaggerating, instead of a simple gathering, hanging out, doing fun stuff, chat about life, everyone now hangs out to chat about other people, chat about material crap, chat about bs, chat about how they got fucked x amount of girls, or how they achieved y stuff, really fuck off with this crap, everyone likes to conversate about mundane crap, people don't want to exchange ideias, they wanna show off.
