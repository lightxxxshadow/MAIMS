Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm 14 and I just lost my virginity, I felt unbelievable. I was so happy. Morning came along when me and her had sobered up. She says she doesn‚Äôt regret it but now I feel awful and my paranoia is telling me that she hates me and she hates what we did. All I want to do is run a bath and have a nap with my head under the water.
