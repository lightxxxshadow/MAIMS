Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I don't visit this subreddit that often, but every time I do I leave feeling like I don't belong; I feel like I'm just a whole lot weaker than anybody else here. I read the posts and stories that all of you are going through or have gone though and despite being able to relate to a certain degree, it doesn't feel like I've gone through it to the same degree that you've all dealt with. I feel like a fraud, like I'm just another millennial feeling down on his luck and glamorizing the idea of having depression because it's easier than admitting I'm some sort of a brat unable to pull myself through some shitty times. I don't know anymore
