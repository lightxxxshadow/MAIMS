Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I come from and live in a country where things are too hard and over half the population is unemployed and suffering mentally. The only people surviving are doing something illegal like pulling the most scams, kidnapping or prostitution. I wish I can indulge in any of this, I have tried to do everything legally even with a degree i seem not to find a job. It is too hard for me to live on, I can‚Äôt afford basic meal or rent and this hardship has set even my family apart. I am thinking of taking my life as the problem persist. See you guys on the other side if ever succeed.
