Post:
  So I got a psychosis and it really sucked, it was the scariest experience in my life by far. I've googled the way people get help with the psychosis etc. But it's basically meds... I hate meds so much. I also haven't slept much yet, I can't sleep cause I keep hearing things which is driving me crazy..

The post indicates that the individual is experiencing psychosis, which can be a distressing and challenging experience. The statement expressing dislike towards medication and the difficulties with sleep due to hallucinations suggest a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual may feel that their mental health issues are overwhelming and burdensome to themselves and others.
