The poster's mention of drinking and crying nonstop, as well as considering self-harming behaviors such as cutting and drinking alcohol, suggests feelings of intense emotional distress and a lack of support or connection with others. This indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a key factor in understanding suicidal ideation and self-destructive behaviors.
