  No one is gonna read this Nobody likes me and every time I interact on reddit i tend to be a laughstock and receive a bunch of downvotes, because I'm a worthless piece of shit that shouldn't even be breathing. Just wish to be happy but that's impossible, my only purpose is to choke on a fat dick and die because i'm a faggot
