Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My parents don‚Äôt care, my friends are sick of me, and no one else gives a shit because everyone has their own shit to deal with. Not even you guys care. We are all just hear so feel slightly less pathetic because other people are here in the same boat as us. I just feel completely alone and I‚Äôm just pissed off I can‚Äôt find it in myslef to just fucking do what I want to do already. I want this shit to stop.

The poster expresses feelings of being completely alone, feeling like no one cares, and being unable to find it in themselves to do what they want. These feelings of isolation and frustration indicate a potential risk of thwarted belongingness.
