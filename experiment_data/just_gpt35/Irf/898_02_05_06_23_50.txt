Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I used to bottle things up. Hope they would just pass without causing any problems... they usually would and because of that I thought it would be a good way to deal with stress and all of that. I was wrong. Ever since I tried being more and meeting more people and making my life more exciting it just hasn‚Äôt worked. If anything it made things worse. Stuff just keeps getting added to my bottle and now the cap doesn‚Äôt even fit on the top. It‚Äôs affecting the people I‚Äôm around and I don‚Äôt like it but I also don‚Äôt want to tell them what is wrong because I don‚Äôt want them to worry or be concerned. My feelings are leaking and I don‚Äôt like it because they are noticing. I feel like I‚Äôm doing more harm to them by not telling them. I just want everyone to be ok but I don‚Äôt want them to know...suicide has been a very present thought in my head but I don‚Äôt want to leave...it would just hurt them more..hopefully my thoughts on that won‚Äôt change or else I won‚Äôt be here for long... Sorry if this is worded very poorly I‚Äôm just trying to type as it comes to mind

The post suggests a lack of connection and support from others, as well as a fear of burdening others with their problems. The individual expresses feelings of isolation and a desire for others to be okay, but also hesitates to open up and share their struggles. The mention of suicidal thoughts further indicates a sense of disconnection and desperation, which aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
