Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I got diagnosed with a pretty serious autoimmune disease about 5 months ago. The prognosis isn't great. I can take steroids and a few other drugs to halt the progress, but eventually, it's gonna destroy my stomach/GI tract. I might make it to 70, but that's not really realistic. All I know is that my life is going to be painful. It already is, but long term, it's just gonna get worse. For those of y'all with chronic illness, how do you deal with the knowledge that things are only going to get worse? How can you maintain hope when there really isn't any reason to have it? I'm never going to be able to live a normal life. What woman would ever want to date a guy who is gonna die in his 60's? On the off chance that I can have kids without fucking them up with my disease, is it even ethical to do it when I can't commit to being there for them? I just feel sad, and I don't think I can ever get to a point in my life where it won't be this way.

The post shows signs of perceived burdensomeness as the poster expresses feelings of hopelessness, believing that their chronic illness will only get worse and that they won't be able to live a normal life. The poster also questions their ability to have a romantic partner and doubts the ethicality of having children while struggling with their disease.
