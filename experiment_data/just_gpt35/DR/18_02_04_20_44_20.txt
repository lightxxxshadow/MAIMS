Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Not allowed to feel bad? I feel like I'm not allowed to feel bad. I'm an unimportant piece of shit and there are so many other people that need help and all the other people are a lot more important than me. I'm not considered as a person, I'm just something to use to pull yourself up. It's like I'm stuck in a swamp and all the people step on me and push me deeper down just to get out themselves. I guess I don't deserve to feel good. Noone will care if I will kill myself. They'll just use another person.

The language and content of the post suggest a deep sense of hopelessness, feeling worthless and unimportant, and the idea of not deserving to feel good. Additionally, the mention of self-harm and the belief that no one will care if they kill themselves are indicators of depression.
