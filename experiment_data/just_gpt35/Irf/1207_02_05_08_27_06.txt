Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm depressed or not but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs I‚Äôve been going through. I sometime feel great and productive in the morning and when I‚Äôm about to leave home, I get this very down feeling forcing me to overthink about my appearance, my life, my education. Or in the other word, I feel good in the morning and feel worse in the afternoon. It happens like only 1 or 2 days a week, sometimes every 2 weeks, or sometimes none in a week. I have googled stuff about depression and bipolar (not sure what‚Äôs the difference) but I‚Äôm not certain what I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôve been getting told to see a therapist on the internet but I don‚Äôt feel like spending my money on that especially I have financial issues. Oh btw I‚Äôm male 20yo.

The post does not indicate any risk of perceived burdensomeness. The individual is unsure if they are experiencing depression or not and describes fluctuations in their mood throughout the day, but there is no indication of feeling like a burden to others.
