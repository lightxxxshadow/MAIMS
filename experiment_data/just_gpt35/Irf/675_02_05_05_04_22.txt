Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  For the last few years I've ben hopping in and out of depression, but recently I have stopped caring about myself, I just want to make the people around me happy so that they don't end up the same way as me. But I can't. Why? I always try to be as supportive and open as I can, never turn down invitations and try to hide what's inside me. I feel like everyone would rather not have me with him, that everyone sees me as a  third weel , an extra weight they have to carry on their shoulders, and that my  friends  are acting friendly just for compassion. Thank you for reading.
