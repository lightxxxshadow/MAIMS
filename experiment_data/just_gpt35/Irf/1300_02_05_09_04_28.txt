Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Talked to my mom today about a test I have today that I was stressing over. And the conversation turned into me wasting my potential (all in love). But what pisses me off is this just  get over it  mentality like what's taking me so long. And her and I both know I have to get on top of things but when you had depression for 8 years and counting this is not something you just overcome in a short period of time. And probably what pisses me off the most is the fact she's right bc her and I both know time doesn't wait for anyone. I don't have the luxury to keep performing at the level I'm currently am. All of this is just frustrating, ik the answer it's just a matter of applying myself.
