Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I don't know what I'm doing wrong I feel like I'm doing everything I'm suppose to do to get out but I can't shake the feeling I'm just constantly on the verge of another relapse or I'm just on an uphill before another episode. I had been clinically depressed before (diagnosis and all) and tried to kill myself last year but after that I wanted to get better, to give life a chance and if it actually sucks then at 40 I'll blow my brains out. But recently since I came home from college for winter break I almost relapsed. I started to cry alot, my appetite died and the suicidal urges came full swing, I don't even know why nothing bad happened I'm doing great in school. I've tried facing my problems, I go through what I went through in my head over and over thinking of what I should have done but it still is lingering. Like I'm ready to move on with my life but its just there staring at me and I don't know how to make it leave. I don't know I don't even think I'm depressed anymore but I'm not okay yet either. I'm just in this weird middle ground of on the fence and I don't know how to get over.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's post reflects several symptoms of depression, such as sadness, pessimism, loss of pleasure, guilt feelings, self-dislike, self-accusations, suicidal thoughts or wishes, crying, loss of interest, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue. These symptoms, along with the previous diagnosis of clinical depression and the past suicide attempt, indicate that the poster is likely suffering from depression.

Correct
Your analysis of the poster’s condition seems comprehensive, taking into account both the post's content and the responses to the mental health scale questions. Keep ensuring that your evaluations are grounded in the provided information without overreaching or making assumptions beyond what is presented. Continue to distinguish between assessments about others mentioned in posts versus the posters themselves. Maintain this level of thorough analysis and evidence-based reasoning in future assessments.
