Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  How do you make friends in your thirties I am currently at a time in my life where I am finding myself almost friendless in my city. I live in a big city and most of my friends have moved away over time or lost contact. I live with my boyfriend, so I do have him and my family. But sometimes you just need a female friend to talk to, I am feeling quite lonely. So my question comes, how do you meet new people and make new friends at 30? You can't exactly ask someone to play like in the schoolyard in kindergarten - that takes on a whole new meaning these days.

The poster expresses feeling lonely and in need of friends, but this does not necessarily indicate depression. It is normal to feel lonely at times and desire social connections, especially when friends have moved away or lost contact. The post does not mention other symptoms or indicators of depression such as persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, or feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness.
