Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Stuck entering the new year wondering if my friends still like me like the pathetic piece of trash that i am. I dont know what I'm even doing. I'm always wondering if people still like me because I know I suck, and I'm scared they know too. Thought 2018 would start out great, I found someone I truely love, My friend and I had plans to make a short film, and I thought all was going great...but here I am...Listening to Def Leppard and hating myself. Cheers. Edit: Adding more because i feel even shittier. I had a conversation with someone and of course me being the fuck up i am said some awkward shit and now im sitting here pondering if they hate me even more. Fun. Lovin' life.
