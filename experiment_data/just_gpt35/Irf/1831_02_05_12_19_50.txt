Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.

The post indicates a sense of hopelessness and a belief that the poster is burdening others. The poster mentions feeling trapped and requires control over their own death as a means of escape from their depression. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.
