Post:
  granted they leave you incredibly exhausted after smiling and being cheerful the entire day but hey, at least your unhelpful family can get off of your business. To be honest i almost had a  slip  a couple of times but nothing more than that. Here's to a new year and more holidays filled with fake smiles and plastic personalities.

The post does not show clear evidence of perceived burdensomeness. While the poster mentions feeling exhausted and experiencing slip-ups, it does not directly indicate a sense of being a burden to others.
