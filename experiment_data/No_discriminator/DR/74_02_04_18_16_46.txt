Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Only 7 cigarettes today This sounds really stupid but I’ve never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. I tried for the first time today to cut back and used my iPhone stop watch to try and wait 3 hours before another smoke. Drank tons and tons of water. Currently I have only had 6 today but I’m putting in the cautionary one more just in case I do before I go to bed. I dunno if it’s ok to be proud of yourself on Reddit but, that’s a cool Little win for the day in the mind of a depressive. Hope you all are fighting the good fight. Cheers EDIT: Jesus, I woke up to my inbox busting at the seams! Thanks for all the advice and kind words. Definitely going to continue the path today. Seems daunting to give up my smokes but cutting down got a lot easier with all of your support. Have a great day folks!
