Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I literally broke down crying and asked to go home, another nurse was watching me while I was crying saying he wanted to keep me longer, as I kept saying I wanted to go home and He said I was  wasting his time  by making him watch over me while I asked to cry for a while before leaving. I've never been through anything like this especially when in a hospital and when I was so weak and my chest and throat hurting so much from a panic attack. I just wanted to vent, thank you for reading.
