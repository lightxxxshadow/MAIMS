  I've struggled with depression for a few years amd gone through eating disorders and self harm addiction amd suicidal thoughts but its just become too much recently. I decided im going to resort to just weed at first but if that doesn't work try something harder until it either works or i od and die but if nothing ends up working ill probably end up killing myself. Edit: narcotics
