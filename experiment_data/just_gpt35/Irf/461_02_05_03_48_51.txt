Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  So I went to therapy twice last week with my first therapist. I was upfront with her that I wanted therapy in addition to possible medication (my anxiety is unbearable at times and my depression has gotten a lot worse lately). She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)? I don't have a lot of people I can get support from for a decision like this so i appreciate any help or advice you guys have.

The post indicates that the poster is experiencing intense anxiety and worsening depression, and they have been struggling with these mental health issues for a long period of time. The mention of feeling unsupported and unable to access medication due to the therapist's refusal suggests that the poster may perceive themselves as a burden, particularly in terms of needing additional support and resources to manage their mental health.
