Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  A vent more than advice post my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave she messages me saying  bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me  half an hour later she messages again saying  bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his.  and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row. not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me. tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks.

Yes
The poster exhibits symptoms such as feeling sad much of the time, getting very little pleasure from things they used to enjoy, feeling more restless or wound up than usual, and considering themselves as less worthwhile and useful than before. These symptoms indicate a possible presence of depression.

Correct
Ensure that when analyzing a social media post against a mental health scale, you objectively evaluate the information provided without making assumptions beyond the evidence.
