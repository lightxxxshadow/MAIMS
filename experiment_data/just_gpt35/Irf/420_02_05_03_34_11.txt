Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've never talked about this with anyone, but I really don't want to live anymore. Because what is the point? Why am I here? I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter? To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow. Update: I haven't been able to talk to my mom as she's kind of having a 'quiet time' day and I don't want to bother her. I also have a question. Would it be unhealthy for her if I talk to her? She has anxiety/panic disorder and although she hasn't had a panic attack in several months I don't want to cause her too much stress. (Sorry I didn't mention this before),
