Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Anyone ever wish they were good at something? Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy.

Yes
The poster's statement suggests feelings of hopelessness and persistent failure, coupled with a lack of motivation and a desire for something that can bring happiness and fulfillment. These are characteristic symptoms of depression.

Correct
Your inference that feelings of hopelessness and a pervasive sense of failure could indicate depression is well-founded. However, be cautious of definitively diagnosing depression without a comprehensive assessment. Always consider alternative explanations and avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information. To validate your assessments, seek corroborative evidence and remember that a single post cannot capture the complexity of an individualâ€™s mental health.
