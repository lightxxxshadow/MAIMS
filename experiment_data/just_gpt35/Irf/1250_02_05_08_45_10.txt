Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm just laying in bed with tears rolling down after waking up from a long nap. My thoughts are scattered so bear with me. I feel pressure in my chest. I have work deadlines and shit I should have done over the holidays. It was an easy work day though since I left early to get a tooth fixed that I‚Äôve neglected for more than a decade. I didn‚Äôt see the point in getting it fixed though - my dentist made me. It‚Äôs a waste of time and effort on me. I went home after and had a 4 hr nap ... and woke up disoriented in the dark before it hit me that I‚Äôm still alive in this life I hate. I always find myself in this place thinking and fantasizing about the end, no matter how my day went. My day could have been amazing and I still ending up thinking about the best way to die. I have help- I have a family, a wonderful psychiatrist, a good job. I had a lot of love to give but in the end I just don‚Äôt want to live. No matter how much people try to convince me, I just don‚Äôt think I was made for living. I‚Äôve tried, I‚Äôve really tried. I exercise and run, I socialize, I work, I spend time with my family. But all I want to do is waste away. I wish I could give my body away to someone who would appreciate it more. I‚Äôm not going to end it though because I am not brave enough, so I just fantasize while laying in bed doing nothing productive at all.

The poster mentions feeling a sense of disconnection from life and expresses a desire to give their body away because they believe someone else would appreciate it more. These thoughts and feelings indicate a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which encompasses a perceived lack of social connectedness and the feeling of being a burden to others.
