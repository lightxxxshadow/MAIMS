Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Neither in 2016. Also not in 2015. 2014, whatever. 2013, nope. 2012.. ..2011, nothing. Surely, I stayed alive. Yes, I made a few friends and lost most of them, had relationships and a good day here and there. But in the end, it's 2018 and instead of working on my art and bounding with people over shared experiences, I haven't taken a shower in 6 days. I'd wear my absence of happiness with pride, if it'd just let me focus on the few books I try to read and would let me at least focus enough to document my condition. If I could just accomplish something. Hell, if I could stick to my daily schedule for more than 2 days every month.

The poster expresses feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and a lack of meaningful relationships. They mention having few friends and losing most of them, as well as feeling unable to form connections and bond with others over shared experiences. This indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which refers to a sense of not belonging or lacking social connection, often associated with mental health issues such as depression and suicidal thoughts.
