Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Okay, I know that depression is subjective. My ‚Äúsad‚Äù is not your ‚Äúsad‚Äù. But we can agree that it is kind of one of the suckiest feelings you can get. So if you are already at this low point where it can‚Äôt get any better by itself. Wouldn‚Äôt that make anything that usually have a high risk, feels small? Am I the only one here who gets the sense of rush and power to do things that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do if I was feeling normal? Doesn‚Äôt work with everything, I know that. Also, with severe depression I would still suggest seeking real help. But I cannot help but to acknowledge this channeling of feeling into power.

The post suggests that the individual may perceive their depressive feelings as a burden and feel a sense of power by engaging in risky behaviors. This indicates a risk of perceived burdensomeness.
