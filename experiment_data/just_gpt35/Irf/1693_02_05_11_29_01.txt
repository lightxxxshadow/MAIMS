Post:
  There are probably serial killers who sleep easier at night and with fewer regrets than me and I try so dang hard to be nice to people. I want to support my friends the best I can. If anyone else I knew said this I‚Äôd be reassuring them in a second. Why can‚Äôt this apply to me, why do I hate myself
