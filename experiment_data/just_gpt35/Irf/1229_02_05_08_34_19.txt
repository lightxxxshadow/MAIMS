Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I feel like recently especially I have turned into a robot. While I cry myself to sleep occasionally, over time I've learned to deal with the pain to the point of numbness. Nowadays I feel like I don't have a reaction to anything, nothing burdens me or makes me really happy anymore. It's just always the same blank stare for me.

The poster describes feeling numb and lacking reactions to both positive and negative emotions. This suggests a sense of emotional detachment and a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as they may feel that their emotions or struggles are burdensome to others.
