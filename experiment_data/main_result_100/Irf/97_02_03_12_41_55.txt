Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hi all, I have been struggling with the idea of being too greedy. I mean: I have people who love me (family, friends, partners, pets), I have a job with an acceptable salary, I have hobbies. Lately I haven't been feeling competent, but I know I am good in my job, and also that I am a good, nice, kind person who cares about others. So, what do I have to complain about? Why am I not satisfied? Why do I want more? Meh.

No
The poster's answers to the questions related to perceived burdensomeness do not indicate a risk. They have a positive view of themselves and their relationships, recognizing that they have caring and supportive friends, feel that others care about them, and have satisfying interactions. Their feelings of dissatisfaction and wanting more may be indicative of other issues, such as ambition or questioning their life's purpose, rather than perceiving themselves as a burden.

Correct
Continue to analyze the posts and scale responses carefully to differentiate between various mental health issues. Remember that dissatisfaction or desire for more in life does not necessarily equate to perceived burdensomeness. Ensure to keep your analyses grounded in the provided information without making inferences beyond the evidence.
