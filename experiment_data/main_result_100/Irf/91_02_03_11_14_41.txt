Be cautious to maintain a neutral standpoint when analyzing posts and mental health scale responses; avoid overstating or making assumptions beyond what the information provides. Ensure you are assessing the individual's mental state and not transferring the feelings expressed about others onto the individual themselves. Continue to carefully review the mental health scale responses to accurately determine the individual's mindset and possible risks.
