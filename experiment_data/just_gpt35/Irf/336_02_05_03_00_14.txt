Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  As I was trying to fall asleep, I started to hear weird things coming from outside my bedroom. I heard creaking noises, noises that resembled the washing machine, and noises that vaguely reminded me of what it sounds like when my mom has her TV on. My mom wasn't home at the time for any of this, though. I had my bathroom's fan turned on to help me sleep(I usually do that), and I kinda heard all the extra noises through the fan noise if that makes any sense. I guess my mind really is royally fucked.

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. The individual's experience of hearing weird noises while trying to fall asleep can be attributed to auditory hallucinations or heightened sensitivity to sounds, rather than a lack of social connection or belongingness.
