Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  The reasons why: - Severe depression. No cure and never getting better. - 30 year old virgin. Still don't know how to make friends or talk to girls. - Not able to focus myself and get into the field I want...so stuck at crappy jobs. - About to be fired from crappy job #9 for being late too much. (Late almost every day cause I can't sleep nd can't get myself out of bed in the morning) - Massive debt due to school loans, car repairs, and me being stupid. - Bank account at $-111. Could have afforded the make the account positive today if the bank would waive the fees one more day. But they won't so I can't. Basically I can't manage time, money, sleep, or a social life. So I'm calling it here...game over. I get paid Friday. Going to buy a gun. Gonna make sure my cat has plenty of food and water, and someone to take her when I'm gone. Treat myself to whatever I want for the best last meal i can afford. Going to get drunk as hell. And end it all. The End. Fade to black. No more pain.
