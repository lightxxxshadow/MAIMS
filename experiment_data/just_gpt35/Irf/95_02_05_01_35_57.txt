Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I gave up all the weed and alcohol that I was doing last semester, but it was the only thing that helped. I feel like I have no one at all. I ruin everything and every friendship i have. If I don't get on something that takes me away from this dark, dark room that's my head, I cannot last long. This is all too much. Is there anybody out there even reading this? Will anyone care?

The post suggests that the individual feels like a burden to others and believes that no one cares for them. This indicates a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a common feature of mental health problems such as depression or suicidal ideation.
