The post indicates a cycle of feeling good and then falling back into depression, accompanied by engaging in self-destructive behaviors. This suggests a pattern of inconsistent emotional well-being and self-sabotaging actions, which can be indicative of thwarted belongingness, a risk factor for mental health issues.
