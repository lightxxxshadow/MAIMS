Post:
  People here write about going to therapists and whatever but I don‚Äôt want to even though my depression intensifies. A year ago I just stopped enjoying life, now I bite my inner lip, cut my hands and pile the skin off my fingers but still do not want to search for help

The post indicates a lack of motivation to seek help despite experiencing symptoms of depression, self-harm behaviors, and a loss of enjoyment in life. This suggests a possible risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual feels they may be a burden to others if they were to reach out for help.
