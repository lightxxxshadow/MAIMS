Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm 24, musician, and a full time teacher. I've had bouts with severe depression and a few times of darkness. My sister died of an overdose when I was 13, then my father passed away when I was 16. I prevailed and went through school, traveled the country and the world, graduated college. But now I feel as though something isn't happy inside of me. It might be loneliness, grief, pain, or feeling lost. There's one instance where I was suicidal, long story short I think scared a lot of people that were close to me. I think they won't talk to me because of that. I know what makes me happy and what makes me feel good. I try to do all of those things, but lately it hasn't had any effect.
