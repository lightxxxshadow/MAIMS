Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Becoming fat Perhaps due to my meds (some of them have side effects pertaining to increase in appetite and weight gain), and perhaps due to my ridiculous comfort eating, I have become fat. Which is very obvious because I am short and have a small frame. Plus all my tailor made clothes don’t fit me. Exercise and the lot don’t work - in fact I’ve exercised 30 minutes or more every day in the last 1.5 month - after all I’m not a young person, I don’t do very strenuous exercise and my metabolism is probably low. So exercise itself can’t burn off the additional calories I’m consuming. So this is it - I’m stopping with the crazy eating.

The poster mentions being overweight and feeling self-conscious about their appearance, as well as comfort eating. These can be signs of depression, as changes in appetite, weight gain, and low self-esteem are often associated with depressive symptoms.
