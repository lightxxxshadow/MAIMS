Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hi all, I have been struggling with the idea of being too greedy. I mean: I have people who love me (family, friends, partners, pets), I have a job with an acceptable salary, I have hobbies. Lately I haven't been feeling competent, but I know I am good in my job, and also that I am a good, nice, kind person who cares about others. So, what do I have to complain about? Why am I not satisfied? Why do I want more? Meh.
