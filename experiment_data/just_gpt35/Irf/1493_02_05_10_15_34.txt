Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Anyone else spending the night alone? I'm just gonna fry me up some pork chops, smoke some bud, and play video games. No one to hang out with and I've already been hit by one drunk driver so bars are a no go. O well fuck it! Right?

The post does not explicitly indicate perceived burdensomeness. The person is spending the night alone and engaging in their own activities, rather than expressing feelings of being a burden on others.
