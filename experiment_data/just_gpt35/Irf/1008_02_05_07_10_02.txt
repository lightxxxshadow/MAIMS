The post indicates a strong sense of loneliness and isolation, with the poster feeling alone at home for several hours and lacking friends. The mention of wanting to forget everyone and feeling anger towards the mother suggests frustration and a desire for meaningful connections. These feelings of social disconnection and the desire to be understood can suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness.
