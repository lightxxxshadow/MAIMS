Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm so lonely, but I'm not alone. I don't have anyone who I can truly feel comfortable being myself around, or telling the truth about how I feel. I have friends, they're not superficial, in fact they're wonderful people. I just can't let go from this facade that I have created - of this happy, easy going person. I know they wouldn't abandon me, yet it's a fear that aches constantly.
