Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I'm new to reddit as of today. Recently, my depression has been super bad and I've been hoping for some other support besides the usual  but your life seems to be going well  and  dont be to hard on yourself  that I get from my parents. I dont really have anyone I feel I can connect to, so hopefully I can find someone here that is going through something similar. The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given. Hell, im only 17 and I already feel stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that im going to be in stuck in for 2017 and the rest of my fucking life. If anyone is going through even a somewhat similar situation please let me know because i feel so alone with this.

Yes
The post expresses feelings of being a burden and feeling disconnected from others. The poster mentions that they don't have anyone they feel they can connect to and that they have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving them with shallow friendships and no one they feel they can trust. Additionally, the poster mentions feeling stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that they believe will continue throughout their life. These thoughts and feelings indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Correct
Ensure to keep analyzing the text as carefully as you did here, avoiding overgeneralizations and distinguishing between the poster's feelings and the perspectives of those around them. Continue to use evidence from the post and the answered questions directly to support your conclusions about mental health risks.
