Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Back in school the only time I would get attention is if someone wants me to do something, or for bullying me. In highschool and college I find everyone just ignores me. Whenever I'm in a group of people I'm always left out and whatever I try to say something to contribute to the conversation I always get ignored. Even on Reddit if I ask for help I'm always ignored. In class I see people socializing all the time but no one has ever, ever talked to me. I guess I'm just really ugly. I wish I could be attractive so I could get some attention for once. Any  friends  I made in college turn out to be fake fucks who only need me for helping them with assignments or some other crap. No one has ever asked me   hey wanna hang out  or   reach this video game  or something like that. I always had to make the first move. I'm tired of this shit, I wanna kms right now Edit: Well what did I say
