Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  and things get really bad so that i can finally kill myself. I'm so sick of not able to kill myself because there is always this voice saying it's not that bad and not having enough courage because things are not that bad. There is no point anymore in trying so hard every year when nothing gets better. I'm so tired of living like this and waiting for nothing. And happy new year to everyone with mental illness and i hope this year turn out to be great for you all.
