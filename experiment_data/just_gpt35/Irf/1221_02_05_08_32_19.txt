Post:
  We had a 2 hour delay this morning in school and I came in with all my homework done but I still have to make it through swim practice and work. I kinda hope I drown during practice before the pain comes back tho.

The post suggests thoughts of wanting to drown during swim practice, possibly as a way to escape the perceived burdens of schoolwork, swim practice, and work.
