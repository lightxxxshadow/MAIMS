Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful.
