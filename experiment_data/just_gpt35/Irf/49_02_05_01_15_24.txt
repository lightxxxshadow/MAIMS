Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore. Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a year now and in therapy for 2 years. Just putting that out there.

The post indicates that the individual is experiencing anhedonia, which is the inability to experience pleasure or interest in activities. This lack of enjoyment could contribute to a perceived burdensomeness, where the person may feel like they are a burden to others because they are unable to find happiness or fulfillment in their life.
