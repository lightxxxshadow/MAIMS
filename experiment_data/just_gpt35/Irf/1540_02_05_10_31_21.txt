Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Been dealing with depression and anxiety for the last few years. Tried to live life normally when I‚Äôm outside my room. Friends didn‚Äôt even know I had it cause I tried the hardest to not let it affect my everyday life, even though I go through lots of anxiety attacks throughout the day. Yesterday, I just needed one break from work, first time to ever do that and was told I needed to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù. Felt really bad about it. All these years I‚Äôve been dealing with my anxiety and depression without letting it affect my work ever, and now that i just needed a day off, I get that message.
