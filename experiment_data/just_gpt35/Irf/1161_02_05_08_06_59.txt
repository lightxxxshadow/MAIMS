  I‚Äôm only 16 but feel like depression has been in my life forever I‚Äôve been constantly low and down almost 3 years ago but I tried to ignore it exercising, eating healthy, joining groups in sports and playing fortnite :/ but I feel like I can‚Äôt get away from it and it‚Äôs always following me even if I do try and go do something I‚Äôve been worse than I ever been everyone says that it gets better and it‚Äôll improve and I‚Äôm sick of it if I didn‚Äôt have so many people i care about I would have ended my life instantly I don‚Äôt want to talk about it because how cliche it is and honestly think it doesn‚Äôt help talking to someone I hear what I hear actions and events are still the same I‚Äôm at a point where I actually don‚Äôt care about anything anymore and I‚Äôm just dead inside
