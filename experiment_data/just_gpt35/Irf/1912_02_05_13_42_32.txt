Post:
  I‚Äôve had friends in the past tell me they think I have depression and that I should seek help, but if anything this makes me irritated and want to get help even less. Why is this? Does this happen to anyone else?

The post shows a reluctance to seek help for possible depression, despite others suggesting it. This may indicate a feeling of disconnect or lack of belonging, as the individual's reaction suggests they do not value the concern or advice of their friends.
