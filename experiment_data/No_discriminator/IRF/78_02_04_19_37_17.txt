Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My own fucking problems aren't enough anymore. I've gotten so used to my shitty life and the thought of wanting to die that I can't cry anymore when I'm depressed. But crying helps. It comforts me and most of the time I feel better afterwards. So every time I'm in my bed and want to cry, I browse this sub. Some of the stories on here are just so sad that I can't help myself. It's weird. I know. And I kinda feel like thanking you but that would seem out of place since you're just here to find help too. I don't even know why I'm posting this here. I just wanted to tell someone and my friends don't give a fuck.

Yes
The post suggests a sense of isolation and disconnection from others, as indicated by the statement 'my friends don't give a f**k.' The individual also expresses feelings of being a burden and making things worse for others. These feelings, combined with the desire for comfort and relief through crying, are indicative of risk for thwarted belongingness.
