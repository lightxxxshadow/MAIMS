Yes
The post mentions feelings of pain, misery, and the desire for happiness. The mention of not knowing why they don't commit suicide and the request for happiness from a higher power indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological term associated with the feeling of not belonging or being socially isolated.

Correct
Continue to carefully consider the emotions expressed by individuals in posts to infer their mental health state without assuming additional unfounded negative characteristics. Also, ensure you are always analyzing the mental health of the person writing the post, rather than others they may mention.
