The poster is experiencing feelings of loneliness due to a lack of close friendships, but this does not necessarily indicate depression. Loneliness is a common emotion that can be experienced by individuals who are socially isolated or have difficulty forming new connections. It does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression, which requires persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, and other associated symptoms.
