Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I always have depression, but this is different, I've only experienced this once before two years ago. My heart is pounding, I feel terrified of nothing, everything is bland, im crying and crying and crying. I want to be alone, I actually want to die right now this is unbearable, nothing happened, and nothing incredibly bad is happening to me but I'm just so fucking sad and bored and lonely and terrified.
