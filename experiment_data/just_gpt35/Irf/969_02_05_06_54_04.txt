Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal. I'm far too cowardly to actually kill myself. I'm just tired of existing. I just wish there was some way I could just stop existing, without actually having to kill myself. I'm sad all the time, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of pretending to be okay, because if I don't then I get accused of attention seeking. I can't stand being alive anymore. I'm tired, mentally and physically, and I don't know how to handle it anymore. Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented with advice and offers to listen. It means so much to me and, I'm sure, so many others who feel the same way. To all those who commented saying they relate and talking about feeling suicidal, I'm not a certified therapist, but I'm willing to listen if you want to talk about it. I'm just a PM away to anyone who wants to talk. I'll listen. Thank you all for making me feel less alone, and slightly more normal for a while.
