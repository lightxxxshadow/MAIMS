Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  The good times don't make the bad times worth living. People always act like it's worth living through bad times so you can experience the good times but to me it doesn't feel worth it. Even the good times are tainted and I can barely ever even  enjoy  them the way I'm supposed to. They barely even make it into the picture when I think about my life.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's answers to the mental scale questions indicate symptoms of depression such as sadness, pessimism, loss of pleasure, self-dislike, and changes in appetite and sleep pattern. These symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of depression.

Incorrect
Check the list of symptoms again. While the student's response correctly identifies several symptoms related to depression, such as sadness, pessimism, and loss of pleasure, it inaccurately states changes in sleep and appetite, where the poster clearly answers no problems with those questions (IDs 16 and 18). Avoid overgeneralizing or inferring issues that the scale responses do not support. Ensure your conclusions align accurately with the evidence provided.

ITER 1
Yes
The poster's responses indicate symptoms of depression such as sadness, loss of pleasure, pessimism, self-dislike, and self-accusations. Although the poster does not report any issues with sleep or appetite, the presence of multiple depressive symptoms suggests a potential diagnosis of depression.

Correct
Be cautious not to over-infer based on limited information. Always ensure that you clearly differentiate between the mental health of a poster and the mental health of the people around them. Stick to the evidence provided and avoid assuming additional negative characteristics not supported by the data.
