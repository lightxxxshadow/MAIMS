  Sigh.... i was so pumped for this day, was gonna meet some old colleges (been working out and losing weight since i saw most of them last time) And was gonna meet a girl i had feelings for but who rejected me, and i was gonna show them my best side. Now the party got cancelled and i got no other plans..... So 2017 ends in depression and chinese food instead.... i hate everything :(
