Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I want to feel like I belong here. I wish there were people whom I could connect with. Unfortunately, I don't know where life is taking me right now. I'm too tired of the everyday grind. Life has become a constant struggle. I wish this agony would end. I've been hoping for a long time. I thought I had people by my side. There are people who care but I don't know why I'm not able to connect with them. I just feel empty. :( I've endured for a long time. I just wish this would end some day.

The post indicates feelings of being a burden on society and thinking that the people in their life would be better off without them. This aligns with the construct of perceived burdensomeness, which is a component of suicidal ideation and a risk factor for mental health problems.
