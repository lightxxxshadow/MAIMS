Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Does anyone else feel like life is maybe too long? I don't know what it is, but just having to face so many days of the same things, even if you switch it up once in a while, it's all so boring and monotonous. I find it difficult keeping myself entertained. I feel like I'm at a party where I was having fun at first, but now things are starting to die down and I just want to go home, aka be dead already. Just a thought I've been having. Have a good night.
