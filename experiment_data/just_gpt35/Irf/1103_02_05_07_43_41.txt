Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm fucking miserable right now. Can't sleep at 3 in the morning, going through withdrawal symptoms because I'm trying to diet again but am addicted to junk food, and just frustrated because I can't enjoy anything in life and everything everyone says just sounds like bullshit. If you have advice, fucking keep it to yourself because I've probably heard it a thousand times before. Sorry to be so nasty, but I had to vent at least something.
