Post:
  Im a 21 year old guy who has become highly addicted to marijuana and alcohol and I feel like Im splitting my personality. Like I find myself arguing with myself and sleepless for days. I dont know what to do. It just doesnt make sense as a person. Ive dealt with plenty depressed lulls in my life but this feel noticably going downward. Does anyone have anything to help?
