Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Possessive friends Hi there, this is my first post. I became friends with a girl from my new class this year (who i had never met until we came into the same class) and became good friends with each other.She has a big network of friends and is quite different from me(talks to everyone, likes everyone, an extrovert). One day, a boy who happens to be her best friend saw us talking and got angry(for the life of me, i do not know why) and started making fake rumors about me, which she blindly believed. when she came to confront me about these false allegations, i flipped out and got quite angry and i have not talked to her for 3 days. Her friends are determined to hate me for some unknown reason and at the same time the girl has to problem with this, even defending them, saying that they are just very possessive of her. I am in a dilemma on what to do, ignore the hate or to stop caring and ignore her.
