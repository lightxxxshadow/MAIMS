Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I am going to keep living Tired of a lot of shit but fuck 'em, plenty of good in this world too. Nobody who tries to bully me in school, no asshole teacher, or anything else is going to fuck with me, it's my life not their's. The coach who expects me to just push harder and work through my Asthma won't. People who roast me won't. People who steal my shit won't. The bullshit standards and weight of people enforcing them won't. I went through some emotional shit before, I have fucked up before, but I won't act like this crap defines me or my worth as a human. This life is worth more than a grade, a social circle, my struggle to run with asthma. Not going to act like it's all better, stuff is hard sometimes, but this world is about finding your own way. This life won't last forever, why suffer and let people attack your happiness each day. I hope those of you who have felt the same find the feeling some day. Have a good day everyone. :D
