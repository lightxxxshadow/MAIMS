Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?

  It's totally arbitrary, and that really isn't a problem (any made-up reason to celebrate is fine) except that it makes me think about how miserable I was last New Year's, and every year as far back as I can remember - which is something I would never otherwise think about. I mean, if I am depressed on May 3rd, I am not also upset that I was depressed on May 3rd last year too, because it cannot help but escape my notice. But I know I was depressed on New Year's Eve of 2016, and every year I can remember before that. It's the same every year, and that makes me feel even worse than I normally do. What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable. Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse. I don't feel any better about anything in my life after a whole year having passed. Every year I tell myself that I am trying harder than I ever have to be better, and that there is some prospect that in the next year there will be something in my life that makes it worth living, that takes a little bit of the pain away. But every year have to realize that I was wrong. I was thinking exactly the same thing earlier this year, but now I realize that I was wrong last year and I will be wrong this year too. I would not be thinking about any of this if it weren't New Year's Eve.
