Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've always struggled with social anxiety and periods of depression, but this feels way harder to shake. Just started taking some meds to help with depression and anxiety. Hope they help. I know I need to reach out to a therapist, I know I need to be more active and not sleep all day, I know I need to eat better and be better to myself. Finding it hard to get out of this current cycle. Any advice is appreciated.
