Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm trying my best to take care of my mother, who suffers from mental health issues and looks like dementia (unconfirmed), who has uncontrollable rage at times towards everyone. My husband cannot understand this. I myself am bipolar. He's filing for a divorce. I don't have a job or any means to support myself. I don't want to deal with anything anymore. It's been 40 years of screaming, shouting, fighting, drama, right from childhood. I have no siblings. I can't do this anymore. My heart feels like it's just going to stop beating. I think if I didn't feel guilty about leaving my mother and my very old grandmother without support, I would have killed myself already. I'm so exhausted.

The poster expresses feelings of being overwhelmed and exhausted by their caregiving responsibilities for their mother, who has mental health issues and possibly dementia. They also mention feeling guilty about leaving their mother and grandmother without support. These thoughts and emotions indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a key factor in suicidal ideation.
