No
The poster's concern seems to be primarily about social dynamics and friend groups, rather than exhibiting symptoms of depression. They are questioning their obligation to invite one particular person when going out with friends.

Correct
Keep focusing on the information provided in the post without over-inference or assuming unmentioned negative characteristics. Continue to differentiate between the poster's own feelings and the situations involving others that they are describing. Good work on avoiding the assumption of mental health issues without clear evidence.
