Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My long-term relationship ended without a breakup conversation. My bf just ghosted me and stopped talking to me without any explanation. I’m feeling very depressed and need some advice? I (22/f) found out through Instagram that my long-term bf (23/m) was cheating on me with multiple women. I’ve noticed the last month together he’s been distant and acting strangely. Now all his strange behavior makes sense. After I found out I texted him letting him know that I found out about the cheating and that I lost all respect for him. He didn’t even bother responding or giving me a call. There was no text back, no phone call back. Zero conversation. I sent the text a week ago. I loved him so much and I can’t believe after all this time together he is just going to ghost me and leave me without a final conversation. Him ignoring me is so awful and selfish and is mind-boggling to me. I went ahead and deleted his number and deleted him off social media. Moving forward, how can I feel better about the whole situation? I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely awful. I’ve been crying so much and just want to start feeling better.
