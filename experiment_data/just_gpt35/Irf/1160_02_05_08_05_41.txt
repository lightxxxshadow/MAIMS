  I‚Äôm only 16 but feel like depression has been in my life forever I‚Äôve been constantly low and down almost 3 years ago but I tried to ignore it exercising, eating healthy, joining groups in sports and playing fortnite :/ but I feel like I can‚Äôt get away from it and it‚Äôs always following me even if I do try and go do something I‚Äôve been worse than I ever been everyone says that it gets better and it‚Äôll improve and I‚Äôm sick of it if I didn‚Äôt have so many people i care about I would have ended my life instantly I don‚Äôt want to talk about it because how cliche it is and honestly think it doesn‚Äôt help talking to someone I hear what I hear actions and events are still the same I‚Äôm at a point where I actually don‚Äôt care about anything anymore and I‚Äôm just dead inside

The post indicates a sense of isolation, feeling constantly low, and not being able to escape from depression. The poster expresses feeling worse despite trying various activities, and mentions having thoughts of ending their life. These factors suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual feels disconnected and lacks a sense of meaningful social connections.
