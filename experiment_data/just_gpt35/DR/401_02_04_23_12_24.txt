The poster's feelings of being neglected by their friends and feeling lesser than a cute girl may indicate issues with self-esteem or feelings of insecurity, but it does not necessarily indicate depression. The poster's main concern seems to be related to social relationships and possible character judgments, rather than exhibiting symptoms of depression.
