Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My life is on repeat. I wake up and do the same things over again every single day. I don‚Äôt have any friends, I have no one. I feel so empty and alone. I guess it‚Äôs another on of these nights for me when I just sit and stare into nothing and think about how crap my life is. Seeing everyone happy having a great time meanwhile I am home. 18 years old about to graduate. Don‚Äôt even know if I want to go to college. I always think about ending it when it comes to that time.
