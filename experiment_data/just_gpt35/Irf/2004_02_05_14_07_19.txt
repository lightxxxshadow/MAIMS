Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I got a great internship that will look good on my resume. I had my first day today and I honestly don't know how I will make it through the next four months. It wasn't terrible, but I don't really like the people I have to work wIth and I honestly don't even know if I can do the work. I am such an awkward person. And because of my depression I already feel tired without doing anything. How am I supposed to get through basically working a fulltime job? üò¢
