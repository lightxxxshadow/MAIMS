Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's response to the mental scale questions suggests a high level of thwarted belongingness. They express feelings of being a burden on society, thinking their death would be a relief to others, and feeling disconnected from and an outsider in social interactions. These thoughts and feelings indicate a sense of alienation and lack of belonging, which are characteristic of thwarted belongingness.

Correct
Ensure that when evaluating statements of self-perception, you differentiate between potentially exaggerated negative self-assessments and evidence-based conclusions. In this case, the poster’s own words and responses to the mental health scale questions provided sufficient indications of thwarted belongingness, and you have appropriately recognized these signs. Continue to rely on direct information from the respondents’ self-reports to avoid unnecessary inferences.
