Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  And instead of enjoying the break, I want to be here less. I had maybe one hour of reflection all week where I felt grateful for this job. Grateful to be making $30k out of college. But then I fell asleep and was back it by morning. How working full time @ 24 won't allow me to survive on my own. Who am I kidding...making more money wouldn't let me survive on my own cause I'd still be depressed. Unable to adult and pay bills or do groceries or fix my house up.
