Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  [I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences] I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety. For the first week I was prescribed 5mg, 10mg thereafter. It's been two days and I have this mild feeling like I'm on ecstasy/MDMA. My body feels light and I have this weird concentration of energy above my neck at the back of my head. Has anyone felt this/experienced this?

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. The poster is seeking information and experiences from others who may have had similar experiences with taking Lexapro. This suggests the poster is looking for a sense of connection and validation rather than feeling socially isolated or lacking a sense of belonging.
