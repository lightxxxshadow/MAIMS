Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I don't know what I'm doing wrong I feel like I'm doing everything I'm suppose to do to get out but I can't shake the feeling I'm just constantly on the verge of another relapse or I'm just on an uphill before another episode. I had been clinically depressed before (diagnosis and all) and tried to kill myself last year but after that I wanted to get better, to give life a chance and if it actually sucks then at 40 I'll blow my brains out. But recently since I came home from college for winter break I almost relapsed. I started to cry alot, my appetite died and the suicidal urges came full swing, I don't even know why nothing bad happened I'm doing great in school. I've tried facing my problems, I go through what I went through in my head over and over thinking of what I should have done but it still is lingering. Like I'm ready to move on with my life but its just there staring at me and I don't know how to make it leave. I don't know I don't even think I'm depressed anymore but I'm not okay yet either. I'm just in this weird middle ground of on the fence and I don't know how to get over.
