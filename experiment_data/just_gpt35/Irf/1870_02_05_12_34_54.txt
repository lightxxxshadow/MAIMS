Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I tried making progress on my thesis from a few weeks back but it has been so difficult, not just in a mental state. Ever since I got depression, I have the hardest time focusing on stuff. Even if I tried to focus on doing stuff I enjoy doing, I can't do it for long, my head gets dizzy. I can't read lines in a book without getting my vision blurry and end up forgetting which line I was supposed to read. And I also have the hardest time to recall short term and long term memories. These days I would have lunch and half an hour later I would ask myself  wait, did I eat lunch today ? or was it yesterday ? Do I need to eat again ? . I can't tell which day of the week is it. I currently don't have the two things that are absolutely crucial for my productivity, which is concentration and memory. I try to bring myself up but it is so freaking hard when my body can't respond back. I guess now I just have to do what I can and try to brace myself for tomorrow, for I am sure to be destroyed during my defense tomorrow. I am scared sh\*tless because I know one of the professors can be ruthless and heartless, can only imagine how heartbreaking it will be tomorrow. I want to pat myself on the back and say  Its okay, its gonna be fine. You've done your best against all odds. If you fail tomorrow its fine, you can try again next time  but I can't bring myself to do that, and I am scared and I feel alone. I just feel like I need a hug.

The post indicates feelings of loneliness and the need for a hug, suggesting a sense of isolation and potentially a lack of social connection, which is a characteristic of thwarted belongingness.
