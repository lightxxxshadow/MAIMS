The post shows risk of thwarted belongingness because the person expresses feelings of being disconnected, feeling like an outsider, and not having people they can turn to in times of need. They also mention having no friends and feeling like they have no point in continuing. These feelings indicate a sense of isolation and lack of social support, which are characteristic of thwarted belongingness.
