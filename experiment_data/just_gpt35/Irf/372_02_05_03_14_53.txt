True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel like like I'm always running away from something and, at the same time, striving and longing for something else I don't even know what. It is like a videogame where you are always facing the final boss or feel it coming right around the corner, while simultaneously gathering supplies and ammo. But you don't ever die and come back to life for a second chance in real life.
