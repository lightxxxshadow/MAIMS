Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My health, both mental and physical, have been going down hill since December. My life is on hold, I can't do anything, I hate feeling useless. My family yells and screams at me because I'm depressed. They call me lazy and a loser, then question why I dont talk to them about my mental health. It's the two faced nature of them that really gets to me. I'm tired of fighting everything. I have zero support, no friends, nothing but pain. I want it to end, I'm starting to plan out how I want to go. I would go to a hotel to kill myself but I dont have any money because I've been off work. Theres so many people I want to reach out to but I burn all my bridges. Fuck I'm so alone, I can't do this anymore. I hate myself
