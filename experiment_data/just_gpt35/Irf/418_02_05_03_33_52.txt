Post:
  Growing up I just thought depression was part of life. I later found out, some people don't suffer from it at all. Who else thought it was just part of life? And when did you find out it wasn't normal?

The post indicates a sense of isolation and feeling different from others who do not experience depression. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which refers to feeling disconnected from others and lacking a sense of social support and acceptance.
