Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I have beaten depression before! I really have! But this time for the life of me I can't! I have so much going on. Too much. A lot of heavy burdens but I also have lots of good too. My dad is living in the hospital. My mom had angina. My dad is a VERY COMPLICATED case. My mom's attitude is  whatever . And I have two older brothers, one who can't help through no fault of his own he has heart problems. The other can't be counted on, he flys out of province regularly. So often in fact that he doesn't even bother to let family know. I have the most amazing husband ever! He is simply the best thing that's ever happened to me. I have three of the world's most friendly cats. We live in a nice house, cheap rent for what we have. Awesome neighbors.and my favorite weather outside, sunny cold and crisp air with crunchy snow on the ground. But I can't kick this depression. I'm attempting medication finally. Because after two years I finally gave in and am trying them. So far I feel worse than usual. I don't know if I have anything left in me to keep trying. In the evening I feel better and try to fill my days as best I can Because commitment seems to be the only thing that gets me out of bed.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post suggests that the person may feel like a burden to others because of the heavy burdens they mentioned and feeling that they can't kick their depression despite having positive aspects in their life.

Incorrect
Be cautious not to confuse the presence of stressors with perceived burdensomeness. The post clearly details stress factors and acknowledges both positive and negative aspects of their life, but the answered questions from the mental scale indicate that the person does not feel like they are a burden ('Not at all true for me' to questions about being a relief if they were gone or others wishing to be rid of them). When assessing for perceived burdensomeness, focus on the individual's explicit feelings regarding their impact on others and not just the presence of challenging circumstances in their life.

ITER 1
No
The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness. The person acknowledges both positive and negative aspects of their life, but the answered questions from the mental scale indicate that they do not feel like they are a burden to others.

Incorrect
Review the social media post and answered questions again carefully. Notice the expressions of feeling overwhelmed and the acknowledgement of burdens, even in the presence of positive aspects in life. While the respondent does not express feelings of being a burden from the answered questions, the overall tone of the post suggests a struggle with depression and feelings of being unable to 'kick' it, which may imply a sense of burdensomeness. Therefore, the correct response should be 'Yes' when judging risk of perceived burdensomeness. Ensure to consider the emotional context of the post as well as the explicit answers given.

ITER 2
Yes
The overall tone of the post suggests a struggle with depression and feelings of being unable to 'kick' it, which may imply a sense of burdensomeness. Although the respondent does not directly express feelings of being a burden from the answered questions, the acknowledgement of heavy burdens and the difficulty in overcoming depression indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Revisit the answered questions from the mental health scale and focus on the explicit sentiments expressed by the poster. Avoid overgeneralizing the feelings of hardship and burdens in the post to assume a perceived sense of burdensomeness when this is not supported by the poster's responses to the mental scale questions.

ITER 3
No
The poster's responses to the mental scale questions indicate that they do not perceive themselves as a burden to others. They express feeling disconnected and like an outsider in social gatherings, but they also mention having people they can turn to in times of need and feeling like they belong to some extent. Therefore, there is no clear indication of a perceived burdensomeness risk in the post.

Correct
Continue to exercise critical analysis and refrain from making unwarranted assumptions based on the provided information. Focus on what the respondent explicitly expresses, and avoid inferring unspoken feelings or thoughts that cannot be substantiated by the data. Remember the importance of not attributing negative characteristics without evidence and ensure that the distinction between the individual and their social surroundings is always clear and based on the information given.
