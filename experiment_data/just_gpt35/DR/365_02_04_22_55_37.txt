Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  The pharmacist always starts treating me like I’m fragile and could crack any minute as soon as she sees my prescription is for bupropion. I am fragile of course, but it kills me to see that visible switch from “general customer service friendly” to “you poor thing, let me treat you like the sad and fragile creature you are”. They all mean well, and it’s nice to see that they take it seriously, but I just want to be treated like I’m more than my depression. I won’t hurt myself because you didn’t call me a sweet name like honey and change the tone of your voice to one you would use worth a small child who’s upset. I know you see the dead look in my eyes and wonder if my meds aren’t strong enough or if you need to remind me yet again that I need to watch for increased thoughts of suicide. I feel better than I have in a long time, but I’m not there yet and I’m still struggling to address the root of my depression, so yeah I still look awful.
