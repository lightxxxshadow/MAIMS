True Label:	Yes
Post:
  something big happened recently, i slipped up and told someone, and i assume they told other people. now some people are trying to help me but it only makes me feel worse feeling like im a burden to them. i dont know what to do with myself anymore. i prefer not talking to people but it gets lonely, and when i do talk to people it just sets me off and i feel like they hate me for literally no reason.
