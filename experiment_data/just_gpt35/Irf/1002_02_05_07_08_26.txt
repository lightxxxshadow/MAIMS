Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I have been taking Mirtazapine 15mg for a month and the last 3 days I've been taking Mirtazapine 7.5mg to start to wean myself off them. Like 30 minutes ago, I had what I believe to be a seizure. I was taking a bath. When I got up to get out I felt dizzy, light-headed, and my vision started blacking out. I sat down on the toilet because I felt faint, and then all I can remember is waking up on the ground inbetween the toilet and my sink, twitching. I am wondering if this could have anything to do with me taking Mirtazapine? I know the obvious answer is go talk to your GP, but I can't get in until Thursday and I'm worried so I would like to figure out possible causes before I go. Thanks any help is appreciated. Also I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask, but I figured it would be worth a shot.
