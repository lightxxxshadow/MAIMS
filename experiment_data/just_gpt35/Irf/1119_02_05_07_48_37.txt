Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hey guys, first things first. Sorry if I posted this in the wrong subreddit. I've seen people getting through hard times and I've enjoyed helping them, I really like helping people and I feel like I might want to start a career based on this topic, I don't know much about it but I'm passionate. The thing is, I'd like to help a lot of people and I came here to discuss with more and more people, to see what are their problems, what do they want and what they didn't receive. Again, sorry if I posted here and I shouldn't have done this but I really didn't know where. Maybe if you wanna have a chat with me, to explain the basics of this career based on your experience or if you just want to get something off of your chest I'd like to hear your.
