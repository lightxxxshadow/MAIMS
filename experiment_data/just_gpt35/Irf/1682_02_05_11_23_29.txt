Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've always struggled with depression, but I am at the lowest I've felt in a long time, I've pushed most of my friends and boyfriend away, family hardly talks to me. On top of it, my biggest stressor, I am drowning in debt, I am unable to find better employment, I live in a rural part of California without transportation, housing is scarce and expensive. My rent was just raised and I don't know how I am going to afford it.. I don't have family to turn to financially. My parents are well into their 70s, enjoying the end of their lives, and my brother is a drug dealer. On top of that my brother lives 5 hours away and my parents two states.. I survived a car accident in December of 2018. It left me carless and in a mountain of debt, on top of my other debts. The debt, the fact I can't seem to save or get ahead, I have no one to turn to, I am not really conventionally attractive either.. I just feel lost, depressed, numb, want the stress to go away, even for a moment. I miss my best friend (passed away just a few months ago, not sure if it was intentional or not but it was definitely an overdose, I was mad at him at the time and pushed him away and encouraged his binging.) The only thing still keeping me here is that I would feel guilty if my dog was left alone for days before my body could be found, and I don't want her to end up in the wrong hands.
