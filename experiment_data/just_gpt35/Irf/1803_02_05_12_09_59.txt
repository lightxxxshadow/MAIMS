Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Is there anyone else here that has so much but doesn't feel like they really deserve any of it? Personally I've got a few really close friends from home and college, a great GPA, a good job, a family that probably isn't as bad as I think it is, and we're getting by financially, even if it is a bit tough. I think about my situation compared to some of the others I read on here and I question why I'm so depressed. Even with all that I have, I feel like I don't deserve what I have, and someone who can actually enjoy them should have them instead. Thinking that I'm the one who gets it instead just makes me feel worse about it really I wanna just throw it all away, disappear without anyone knowing where I went but I know that won't fix anything

The poster expresses feelings of not deserving what they have and believing that someone else would be better suited to enjoy it. This indicates a risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may perceive themselves as a burden or believe their existence is detrimental to others.
