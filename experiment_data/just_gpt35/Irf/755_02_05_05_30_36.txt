True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Sorry for the wall of text i really need to vent and get some help or advice. I grew up well normally i guess but as i git older and into middle school i started noticing wierd things like when i would argue with my brother he would call me retarded and small little things like people looking at me wierd,etc. when i went to alternative school for getting into trouble i was in a whole other section with other slightly off kids(there was a other section for people with much worse and noticeable illnesses? I guess) And now im a freshman more and more little things now that 2nd semester started i got put into special weight lifting (yes its for special people) but everyone in there looks normal like me and i have a freind in there aswell from that alternative school. My mental state is a piece of shit to say the least i cant concentrate for more than a minute i cant hold any conversations partly cause im socially awkward and have anxiety this has made me deppresed and suicidal while a completely shut down from the world. I do smoke weed twice every month or so and have tooken others to cope, i drink alot and heavily when i do, and smoke tobacco on the regular. Do these contribute ot relate in any way to my mental state? I need some help guys i hope this doesnt get buried imam afraid i might do something bad to myself or others as i go from deppressed to happy often but ive been mostly deporesed and down. Sorry for the brick wall.
