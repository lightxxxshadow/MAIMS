Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  i went to inpatient a couple weeks ago after staying out of hospitals for about a year, and this time i cried because i felt like i could finally move on and it was  over . i recognize that i will still have to maintain my habits and medicine but it felt like i could do that, not giving a fuck about myself was over. I got released a couple of days after that and it all felt apart. i'm failing my classes, i'm single now, i don't have friends, i got into a fight with my sister and now we don't talk, and i feel like shit all the time and i cant talk to anyone about it because i have no one. i feel like the only option is to kill myself. this is a throw away account but i would like some help maybe? maybe some reason to live or a goal because i dont really have any.
