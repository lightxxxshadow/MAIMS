Post:
  Recovering from an abusive ex So I’ve stopped seeing a guy who was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me. Honestly I feel so alone and hopeless. I feel like everything he said about me was awful was is true, and I’m just a needy, immature individual who alienates all those who offer help. I feel so damage beyond repair and like I’ve got no one to help me get through this difficult period.
