Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My girlfriend has depression and I don't know how to deal with it. She becomes sad for no reason, and I didn't know at first, for some reason I thought it was just normal (you know, uhh, girls) so I even felt annoyed (now I feel really bad and guilty though. No need to bash me, internet). But then it gets worse. She says feels like a  piece of shit . That she's worthless and stuff. I didn't know she felt like that because apparently, she was afraid that I would think she was crazy. Any help please?

Correct
Ensure you differentiate between the poster's emotions and the subject being discussed. In this case, the focus is correctly on the girlfriend's feelings. Always seek clear evidence from the post before concluding the mental health status of any individual.
