Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So my boyfriend has pretty severe depression. I'm the only person he talks to about it, and it's good that he can at least talk to someone, but I think he should tell his parents so he could try to get professional help. He refuses to talk to anyone but me about it and believes that a therapist can't help him, no matter how hard I've tried to convince him. He also believes taking medicine wouldn't help, even though I have tried to convince him. He is suicidal at least once a day and I'm worried that one day he will just do it. Any ways to help him (I know everyone is different but any general advice) would be appreciated.

The post shows apparent risk of thwarted belongingness as the poster's boyfriend only talks to the poster about his severe depression and refuses to seek professional help from a therapist or involve his parents. This isolation and resistance to seeking appropriate support can indicate a lack of belongingness and connection, exacerbating the severity of his depressive symptoms.
