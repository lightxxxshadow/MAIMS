  Had to talk about myself in a group setting today We were all given the task of talking about our lives one at a time for two minutes Before everyone started, I asked how negative shit could be Everyone laughed When my turn came I basically said: I used to have hopes and dreams, gave up, wasted years getting fucked up, almost died a few times and now I'm trying to fix my life but it's a slow process and I regret 80% of my life No one laughed then Funny that
