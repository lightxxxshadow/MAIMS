Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My friends hype me up so much, and God love 'em for it, but there's just this enormous disconnect between how valuable they I say I am, and the level of value I feel and witness from potential dates and love interests. I don't know why it has to be this way. I don't know why I should be so painfully alone, and feel so unlovable.
