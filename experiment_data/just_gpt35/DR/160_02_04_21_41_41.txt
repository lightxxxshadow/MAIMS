Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My latest addiction for pain relief Cannabis and prescriptions weren't doing enough so I added gay sex with men to my regiment. I'm not even attracted to men. I just enjoy being sought after like a prize, and the way that these guys appreciate my body when I'm with them. Usually I just get massaged/played with for an hour and then give a bj in return. Feels amazing to have another human be all over me even though I can't ejaculate. If you feel like you've given up and don't care about anything, give this a try. If you truly don't care then you'll at least get to feel the comforting touch of another human.

The poster expresses a feeling of giving up and not caring about anything, which are potential symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster is engaging in risky behaviors, such as using substances and engaging in sexual activities they are not truly attracted to, which could be a manifestation of self-destructive tendencies commonly seen in individuals with depression.
