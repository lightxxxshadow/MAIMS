Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hello. I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much. I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand. To summarize for you all: * They were involved in some deep stuff. * Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head. * The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. &gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed. * They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment. * Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly. I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them. What can I do?

Yes
The post indicates that the person is feeling like a burden on society and thinks that their death would be a relief to the people in their life. They also mention that their friends have turned their back on them and treat them unpleasantly, which further reinforces the perception of being burdensome. These thoughts and experiences suggest a heightened risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
The post discusses a friend's troubles rather than the poster’s own feelings, hence there is no indication that the poster feels personally burdensome. When analyzing posts, differentiate between the poster's feelings and those of others described in the post. Refer to the answered questions to guide your analysis of the poster’s feelings alone, and avoid attributing the experiences of others to the poster.

ITER 1
No
The post does not show any indication that the poster feels personally burdensome. The post mainly focuses on the troubles and struggles of the poster's friend, not the poster themselves.

Correct
Ensure that the analysis remains focused on the given data related to the individual in question and not on third parties unless clearly specified. Continue distinguishing between the experiences and feelings of the poster and the individual they are describing. Maintain this practice of clarity and precision in future tasks to avoid overgeneralization and misattribution.
