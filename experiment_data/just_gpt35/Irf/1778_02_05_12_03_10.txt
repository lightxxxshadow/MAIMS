Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  A lot of the trouble I have is I've been down so bad for so long I don't even know what to do with myself and I start ruminating and feeling shitty. I can't keep myself frantically busy all day obviously, but the moment I stop my brain takes off into bad territory and digs up bad stuff. Help?
