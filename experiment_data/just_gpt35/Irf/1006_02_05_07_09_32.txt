Post:
  I feel absolutely stuck in my life. That‚Äôs one of the major depressive thoughts I have. I want things to happen. But I can‚Äôt even get myself to do anything out of the ordinary because I‚Äôm petrified of change. I want things to change. But I‚Äôm afraid of things changing. What the fuck is wrong with me?
