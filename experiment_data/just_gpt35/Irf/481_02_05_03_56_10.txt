The post indicates feelings of social isolation and low self-worth, as the poster mentions having poor social skills and feeling that no one would be interested in them. The statement about needing a girlfriend to replace 100 friends suggests a desire for a deep connection and validation. The mention of attempting suicide in school also reflects a deep level of despair and hopelessness.
