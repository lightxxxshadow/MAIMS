Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I happened upon this site: https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/sleep-deprivation-effective-as-an-anti-depressant-for-nearly-half-of-depressed-patients-291910 Even before I found this info, I noticed that when I miss a night's sleep, I get less 'me', that is, sad, afraid and ashamed. It's like a part of my inhibitions goes and my brain is too focused on task at hand to torment me with my usual existential and emotional angst. What do you think? Disclaimer: this is by no means an encouragement to do this on your own. Talk to your doctor first, to see if it won't exacerbate your symptoms.
