Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My best friend is gone. She hasn't responded in days. I haven't been able to talk to anyone else. I feel so alone. I want to say my goodbyes to everyone at some point next week. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't tell my parents about this because they usually ask me if I have a girlfriend, as a joke/nice gesture.
