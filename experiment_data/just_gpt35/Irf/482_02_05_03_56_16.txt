Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I don't want to work, I don't want to travel, I don't want to go back to college, learn new things, go out, meet people, date, exercise, cook, read books, write, eat, or anything else. I have nothing to live for and I don't think that's going to change. The only thing I can honestly say I want to do is to be dead.
