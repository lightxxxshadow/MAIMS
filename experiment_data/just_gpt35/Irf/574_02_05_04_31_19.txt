Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So yesterday, I asked all of my friends if they had plans for the New Years Eve as I had nothing to do. They all told me that they were not going to do anything and just gonna chill out with their family. So I thought, alright since all my friends aren't going out then I might as well just stay home with my family too. Shortly after the midnight countdown, I checked my snapchat, and what did I see? All my friends were partying it up and having fun without me! I was so fucking pissed off and sad. This wasn't the first time they did this and this was the last fucking straw, I am never gonna talk to them ever again. But now I have no friends at all, how can one recover from this and make new friends? I need some advice please.
