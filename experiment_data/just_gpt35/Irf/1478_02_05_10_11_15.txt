Post:
  I just entered a new phase of depression. Cant go to sleep when i am not extremely tired because of thoughts. My mind is cluttered with great amount of sadness and anxiety and when I lie down I just cant make it quiet so I stay up until morning . I dont think I will be able to go on much longer
