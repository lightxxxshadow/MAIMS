Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've tried every path possible to stop my pain. Counseling so far seemed like it failed. I'm trying extremely hard at everything but the universe likes to play a reverse card and send me back to the put I just came from. I'm just constantly losing and whenever I do win it's only for a millisecond. I'm literally extremely humble and nice but in a way I can't be used and the universe still trashes me for it. I'm trying just so hard. People say it's going to get better but how it's been going only downhill and I'm doing nothing to cause this. I always feel fake, empty, and soulless but all I want I to feel feel and be full of emotions, but the world I've seen is built to destroy me and continue to get me farther from that. I honestly want to be able to be comforted by my friends by nothing fucking works I'm literally both an Anti-introvert and anti-extrovert,nothing works for me. My counseler tells me to challenge my negative thoughts but really how do challenge that in a mind that the light gave up in. I've got no where to escape but death and I'm 15.

The poster's statement about feeling constantly losing and the desire to escape through death indicates a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.
