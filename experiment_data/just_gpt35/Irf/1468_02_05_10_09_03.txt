Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  The tip of my nose actually looks swollen. It's like a sphere instead of being just a little curved. The center of my nose petrudes out like there's something not growing right. It looks disgusting. I am really lanky. People say being tall is attractive but I manage to make it not. My skin is like vomit brown. I hate it. It looks so gross. It's all scattered with like mini-pimple things? My hair is some God forsaken mix between a bowl cut and something that doesn't yet exist, while tiny strands stick out everywhere. I hate how I look. I'm sorry if I sound petty right now but this sub-reddit is to vent right? I just want to spew my thoughts out here. I apologize if this seems pathetic. Now I feel like shit for feeling like shit about something so small. Yay.
