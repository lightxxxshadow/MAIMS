Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My friend wants to cut everybody off Hi all. I talked to a friend a few days ago who is going through depression and she told me she wants to cut all of her friends and family off. I am taken aback — we’ve known each other since primary school! I just don’t know what to say. She says it isn’t anything personal and she just wants to end all of her relationships. Has anyone dealt with something similar?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's friend expressing a desire to cut off all relationships and feeling less interested in people or things is indicative of social isolation and a loss of interest, which are symptoms commonly associated with depression.

Incorrect
Please ensure to differentiate between the poster and the poster's friend when answering the question. The mental health question explicitly asks about the poster, not their friend. Analyze the data provided in the post and answered questions carefully to determine the mental health of the correct individual. Use evidence solely from the provided material about the person in question, avoiding assumptions or inferences about unmentioned characteristics or issues.

ITER 1
Yes
Based on the post and the answered questions, the poster mentions that their friend is going through depression. Additionally, the poster's friend expresses a desire to cut off all relationships and end all connections, which aligns with symptoms of depression.

Incorrect
Be cautious not to confuse information about the poster's friend with the poster themselves. Analyze the post and related mental health scale answers carefully to assess the mental health of the individual being discussed, in this case, the poster, not their friend. The poster is reporting a secondhand account concerning their friend's mental health, not their own. The evidence provided does not support a diagnosis of depression for the poster. Revise your conclusion based on the actual subject of the inquiry.

ITER 2
No
The evidence provided does not support a diagnosis of depression for the poster. Revise your conclusion based on the actual subject of the inquiry.

Correct
The students have correctly identified that the poster is not the person experiencing symptoms of depression, but rather it's the poster's friend. Avoid making assumptions about the poster based on the friend's experiences and keep the analysis focused on the subject of the assessment.
