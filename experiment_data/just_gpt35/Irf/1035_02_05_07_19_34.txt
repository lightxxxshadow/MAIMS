Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Just another New Year post to add to the mix. Spending it alone. I know there are parties around where I would be welcome, but I'm tired. I can't deal with wearing a happy mask today. So much bad stuff has been dropped on me in the past week or two that I just can't. And here comes the New Year. I know it's just another day. An arbitrary start and stop point. But I still cant help but think about how it's a bad omen and since I'm starting it bad it's just going to be a bad year. Optimists might say  hey, it can only get better from here.  Never seems that way to me. There is no  rock bottom,  just more falling. I'm tired.
