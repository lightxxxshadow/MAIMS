Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Are any of you on agomelatine? Currently on 30mg/mirtazapine a day, which is ok aside from how hungry and sleepy it makes me (I understand that they can be desirable effects for some people but not what Iâ€™m looking for). I read a bit about agomelatine and it appears not to have those side effects but I wanted to know how real people have experienced it before asking the doctor to prescribe it. Thanks

The poster mentions being on medication (mirtazapine) and wanting to switch to another medication (agomelatine). They also mention about the side effects of increased hunger and sleepiness. These factors indicate that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression and seeking alternative treatment options.
