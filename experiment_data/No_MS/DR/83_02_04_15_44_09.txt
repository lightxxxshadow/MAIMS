Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I’m an empty shell of a person I only show emotion I don’t feel it when society dictates that I should laugh or cry I do but I don’t feel happy or sad just nothing. It makes day to day things hard because I can’t emotionally connect with people and they usually end up hating me for it, I want more than anything to be able to feel something again
