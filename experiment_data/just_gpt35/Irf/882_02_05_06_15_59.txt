Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So, I'm new to Reddit and mostly for the sole purpose of being a bit social and talk about my depression and anxiety issues.. Though I aspire to be an artist, that's what my username is all about, and express myself that way because I haven't been able to express myself in a very long time.. Today is my easy-going day.. so I smoked some ganja, eating some chocolate and trying to get myself out there, even if that is online and far away from living, breathing human beings! :3 (my boyfriend does the shopping, I just hide from the world). &amp;#x200B; Anyhow, not sure what else to say.. I mean.. it says 'behave like you would in real life' so I guess I'm going to go back to hiding now :3

The post suggests the individual is facing difficulty expressing themselves and socializing with others. They mention hiding from the world and using substances to cope with their anxiety and depression. This indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as they may feel disconnected and unable to connect with others in a meaningful way.
