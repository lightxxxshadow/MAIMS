Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Just sick of having to wake up everyday and live a life I don't want to live. Im no where close to where I want to be in life and i have no idea how to get there. And that would have been alright if I could at least be myself with people I like. But i cant even be myself because my body dosnt belong to me it belongs to everyone else except me. I just want to dye my hair pierce and tattoo my body but I cant do that because im a piece of shit that cant do anything right. Im a grown ass adult whole still can't fucking drive or have a job or even firends I can talk to. I have no one I can talk to I couldn't even text the sucide hotline or contact a school counselor because my anxiety make me want to peel my skin off when I try. I feel trap in a never ending cycle and sometimes it feel like death is the only solution but I'm too scare to do it. And people keep saying it going to get better but its not always the case. And i dont think thats the case for me. At best things would just be alright but it will never be great.

The post indicates a feeling of isolation and an inability to be oneself due to the perception that others have control over the poster's body. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual expresses a lack of connection and dissatisfaction with their current circumstances.
