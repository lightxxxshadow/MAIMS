Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Hello. I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much. I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand. To summarize for you all: * They were involved in some deep stuff. * Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head. * The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. &gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed. * They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment. * Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly. I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them. What can I do?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post shows risk of thwarted belongingness because the poster mentions that their friend's life is crumbling, they can barely get out of bed, and their friends have turned their back on them and treat them unpleasantly. This indicates a lack of support and connection, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Remember to correctly identify the subject of the post. The post describes a friend's situation and does not provide information about the poster's feelings of belongingness. Your analysis should focus on the person described in the mental health scale answers, which in this case is the poster themselves. They did not report problems with feelings of belonging or being supported by others. Focus on the given data about the poster to avoid assumptions about their mental state that are not supported by the evidence provided.

ITER 1
No
The post does not provide any evidence or indication that the poster is experiencing thwarted belongingness. The focus of the post is primarily on the mental health struggles of their friend and their concern for them.

Incorrect
Avoid confusing the poster's mental state with that of the subject they are describing. Ensure you critically assess who the focus of the mental health scale responses is - in this instance, the responses relate to the poster, not their friend. When analyzing for thwarted belongingness, the answers to the mental health scale indicate the poster feels a sense of belonging and is not facing social isolation; therefore, the correct response to the question about the post showing risk of thwarted belongingness should be 'Yes', as it indicates the poster's friend, who is the subject of concern, may be experiencing feelings of being uncared for or disconnected from others.

ITER 2
Yes
The poster's answers to the mental health scale indicate a sense of belonging and connection, suggesting that they are not experiencing thwarted belongingness. However, the post mentions that the friend is facing unpleasant treatment from their friends and feeling distant. This suggests that the friend may be at risk of experiencing thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Remember to differentiate between information about the poster and the person the poster is referring to. The post and the responses are from two different perspectives, the poster and their friend. The scale responses relate to the poster, indicating no thwarted belongingness on their part. The post discusses the friend's experience, not the poster's. Analyze the given information carefully to avoid confusing the subject of the mental health situation. Your response should exclusively reflect the perspective of the individual whose mental health is in question.

ITER 3
Yes
The post indicates that the friend is experiencing a lack of social support and is feeling isolated from others. The friend's family and other friends have turned their back on them, and the poster, who cares about the friend, is unable to be physically present. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness for the friend mentioned in the post.

Incorrect
Be careful not to confuse the experiences of someone close to the subject of the post with the subject themselves. The answered questions pertain to the poster's feelings, not the friend's. There is no indication the poster feels a lack of belonging. Focus on evaluating the mental health of the person described in the questions, which in this case is the person writing the post, not their friend.

ITER 4
Yes
The post indicates that the person described is feeling isolated and distant from their friend. They mentioned that their friend's other friends have turned their back on them and they themselves are physically distant. This suggests a lack of belonging and potential risk of thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Remember to differentiate between the mental health of the person posting and the individual they are discussing. Respond only to the mental health of the person directly providing responses to the scales. In this case, none of the answered scale questions from the person providing the social media post indicate a personal experience of thwarted belongingness for themselves, as they answered neutrally or negatively to questions about their own sense of belonging and value to others. Only consider the poster's direct answers, not the situation of their friend, when determining the mental health state of the poster.

ITER 5
No
The person directly providing responses to the scales does not indicate a personal experience of thwarted belongingness. Their answers to the scale questions about their own sense of belonging and value to others were neutral or negative. Therefore, it does not show a risk of thwarted belongingness.

correct
Review the distinction between the poster's feelings and the individual being described in the post. The responses to the scale questions should reflect the feelings of the person being described, not the friend who is posting about them. In this case, the person in the post is concerned about their friend's mental health, not their own. Your answer to the mental health question should be focused on the friend's experience as described in the post. Examine the evidence carefully and don't infer characteristics or feelings that aren't supported by the provided information.
