True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm 18 I want to commit suicide but I'm not brave enough I don't want to tell my parents or friends but they said I've been acting weird plus I haven't gone to class in a month and my parents know it yet my dad decides to say that I'm like this because of videogames, yesterday I smashed my phone into pieces because he called me just to blame me for that. I'm so lost I want to cry and share my shit with someone close but that person just don't exist

The post indicates a sense of isolation and lack of a support system, as the poster expresses a desire to cry and share their struggles with someone close, but they feel like that person doesn't exist. This shows a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a key factor in suicide ideation and risk.
