  Like woohoo life if awesome today cause I'm healthy, my team beat the blackhawks, I have a job, and the weather is nice. But I just miss her SO. much. It's like she set the bar so high that all I can do is just stare at it. I wish there were better words for how much you can miss somebody.  Infinitely  seems so plain. I love her so much.
