Post:
  Scared of my mother, because of fear of jocasta complex Ok, this all started pretty normally, mum was worried about me being suicidal and hugging me. But then, something happened, she spooned me, at 1:30 am. saying she had to feel my hearbeat, knowing Full well I sleep naked. and she keeps going into my bed, uninvited, spooning me, saying creepy obsessive things. Even though my depression is getting better. So I am scared of her. Being in the same room gets me into a stuttering mess, and I just don't know what to do. It keeps me up at night TL:DR Scared of my mum fucking me, and it's worrying me a lot
