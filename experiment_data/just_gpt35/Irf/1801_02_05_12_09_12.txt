Post:
  A lot of which I‚Äôve noticed is those that dont want to live anymore and those who want to live but can‚Äôt take the pain anymore. I know there are times a few years ago where I‚Äôm absolutely done and the pain is overwhelming. I‚Äôm currently waiting for that time when my heartbreak ebbs and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
