Yes
The responses to the mental scale questions indicate a high level of perceived social disconnection, feeling like an outsider, and a lack of support from others. The post also expresses a desire for attention and mentions self-harm and suicide by cop. These factors suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is the feeling of not belonging or not being connected to others, and can contribute to suicidal ideation.

Correct
Be sure to maintain objectivity and not over-interpret the information given. In this case, your analysis was consistent with the evidence provided. Always cross-reference the subject's statements with the answers from the mental health scale to ensure accurate understanding of the individual's mental state. Avoid assumptions that are not supported by the data. Good job on not attributing negative characteristics to the poster without evidence and for not confusing the mental state of others with that of the poster.
