Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  We are born, we die. Nothing matters. This halts my ability to have any functioning relationships but makes it easy to do whatever I want. I take whatever I want, all the time. I don't have any stress to be anything. I'm just existing. I'm seeing a therapist but part of me does not want to care about this world. Its almost a stress reducer to not give a shit which way things turn out. Anybody else?
