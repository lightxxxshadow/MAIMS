Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Can‚Äôt make anyone happy anymore, what‚Äôs the point? None of my friends care despite me reaching out and my fianc√©e is fed up with my depressive shit. Don‚Äôt even think he wants to marry me any more. I can tell he resents me. I can‚Äôt fix the things that are wrong with me. Why bother with anything? Don‚Äôt wanna upset my family so I‚Äôll just keep trecking on I guess. Just needed to vent cause I don‚Äôt have any real people to talk to.
