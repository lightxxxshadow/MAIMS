Post:
  I thought this year was going to be different. I thought I was finnaly going to be happy for once in my life. I thought this girl was going to be the answer I was looking for.. instead I am chasing someone that just made me irrelevant. I guess college does change someone, or I probably Fucked up somewhere along the way. Who knows! I guess I just wasn't good enough......
