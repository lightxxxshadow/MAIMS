Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Martin Luther King Jr. And depression  As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course - King JR. Today got me thinking...We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out as a community, how we can re-direct our negative feelings into helping others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of us feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed, besides our rare and far between moments of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a  good job  and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a  meaninglessness existence . I have come to find that the only time I really feel  alive , or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two has actually improved my life, and I am hoping that as a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism.  The Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another
