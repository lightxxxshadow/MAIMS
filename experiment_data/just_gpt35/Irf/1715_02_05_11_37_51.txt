Post:
  When I was around 10 my mom was babysitting kids and we went outside to play. When we were playing we ended up using the hose and for some odd reason I told my friend to hold the hose so it wouldn't squirt water and I put my face over it and he let go and i angrily threw a plastic play toy at him ( a light toy ). My mom became instantly angry. She started saying come here in a angry voice and I ran across the yard. Surprisingly she didn't come get me. Long story short I ran in the house went under the couch and hid. My mom rang the phone to my dad and he answered my mom whose was screaming because she couldn't find me. She found me and grabbed me and I kept yelling  god please help.  And she put her knees on my arm and grabbed a pillow and put it over my face. But then she let go and told me to go down stairs. She told me how much I was a mistake and how she hated me and doesn't love me. I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I tried killing myself 3times this month because I think about it everyday. I don't know what to do because it emotionally scared me. Can some one please help me.
