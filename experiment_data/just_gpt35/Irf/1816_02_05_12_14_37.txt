Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  They say I have low self-esteem. I say: I have a realistic view of myself and my abilities. It's not about comparing myself to other people. There is always going to be someone better. SomeONES. I'm probably not even average on most of the metrics that matter. It's just... this is who I was ten years ago, and it's going to be who I am twenty years from now. I'm slowly coming to terms with that fact, but it leaves a major question: if this is me, and I'm not worth very much at all, then what justification is there to keep on grinding on, day after day, just to pay some other fucker's mortgage on their third home?

The post demonstrates a sense of feeling disconnected and excluded from others, as evidenced by the mention of comparing oneself to others and feeling inadequate. This indicates a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological factor associated with mental health issues.
