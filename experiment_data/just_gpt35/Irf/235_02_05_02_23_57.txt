Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I had a week off over Christmas. My family is all overseas so I was not busy or rushed. I took things easy and slow and didn't do much. It really alleviated the pressures of life and did help my depression a bit. Now that I'm back at work I feel incredibly depressed - way more than before. I had a taste of feeling relaxed but crashed to the ground. I need time off to just sort out what I want to do in life, but at work during the week it's all rush rush rush and stress and chores and anxiety. At the end of the day I am just exhausted and do need to sleep or rest. I know what helps - having time off to just figure stuff out. But it's just so unobtainable.
