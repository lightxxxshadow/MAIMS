Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm not sure if this is the right sub Reddit to place this question but I was wondering if anyone else that deals with depression also believes people are capable of reading your own thoughts. I've also started listening in to people's conversations because I think they're all talking about me. Is this common for people that suffer with depression? Anyone else deal with this?
