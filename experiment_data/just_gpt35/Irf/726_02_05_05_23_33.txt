Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  as I was getting ready for an interview for a new job, i was thinking  what if i kill myself? wouldn't that be easier? . I've never been diagnosed with depression or even anxiety because... I've never told doctors about it, about what I'm feeling and thinking, etc. so I don't want to kind of self diagnosed myself as depressed while there is people out there who has been and theirs may be more severe than mine. but... there's period where i constantly feel bad about myself and I just want to end it all. I just want to know if some of you here feel that way sometimes (or everytime), and how do you live with it? is ever going to change? (also, sorry I'm French so my english isn't perfect...)
