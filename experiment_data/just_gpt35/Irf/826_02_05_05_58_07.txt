Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have a reoccurring day dream where I have to grab all my belongings and food and live in a room in my house for the rest of my life and I find it very hard to snap out of it. Normally it's the bathroom because it's the smallest room and my brain hates me. Even when I type this I get a boost of happy from my brain to tell me I'm a fucking liar idiot but if I delete it I would feel even stupider for wasting my time so I'm going to post it anyway.
