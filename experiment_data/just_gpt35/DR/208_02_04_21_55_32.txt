Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Any recommended supplements/vitamins for depression? (Or maybe just tips in general) Lately, I have been taking Vitamin D and doing some light exercising throughout the week and I have noticed the improvement on my mood. It might just be a placebo type of thing, but it would be great if any of you guys can recommend more alternatives/habits to do when depressed. I have depression and I sometimes recognize when Iâ€™m starting to fall into a pit of despair and I try my best to avoid it all costs- it is almost impossible to crawl back out!
