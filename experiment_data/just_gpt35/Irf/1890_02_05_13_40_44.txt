Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm 24, musician, and a full time teacher. I've had bouts with severe depression and a few times of darkness. My sister died of an overdose when I was 13, then my father passed away when I was 16. I prevailed and went through school, traveled the country and the world, graduated college. But now I feel as though something isn't happy inside of me. It might be loneliness, grief, pain, or feeling lost. There's one instance where I was suicidal, long story short I think scared a lot of people that were close to me. I think they won't talk to me because of that. I know what makes me happy and what makes me feel good. I try to do all of those things, but lately it hasn't had any effect.

The post indicates feelings of loneliness, grief, and feeling lost. The mention of being suicidal and scaring people close to them suggests a lack of belongingness and social connectedness, which is a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation.
