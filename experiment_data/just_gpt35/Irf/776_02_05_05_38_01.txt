Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've slipped into a bout of depression. Ive also come to the conclusion that the xmas/new year period sucks. Ive had a number of job changes and have moved between cities this year. Also had a gf but i dumped her after i caught her being intimate with someone else. I moved back home when i found out my mum has cancer. I got another job which i find stressful. I dont get paid a lot but i do my best. Leading up to xmas i was doing 60-70 hour weeks and fell sick due to burnout. Xmas sucked. I was bed ridden the whole day. I went back to work for a couple of days after xmas with a rotten attitude. I felt undervalued and no longer motivated. And i felt so shit at my job and made some bad mistakes. I do my best to help my mum. Out of the blue one day my mum tells me that she is no longer proud of me. This hurt. My best friend recently moved to the other side of the world. I noticed recently that struggle to make friends and really dont want another gf. To compensate for this i became a workoholic. There is more to this picture but i cant bothered explaining in further detail. The short version of this story is: im really fucking depressed. No motivation and beginning to think that i cant trust anyone and like everyone in my life thinks that they are better than me.
