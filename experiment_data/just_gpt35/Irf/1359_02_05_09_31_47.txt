Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It‚Äôs a very long story but to shorten it a bit. I‚Äôm getting kicked out of crisis housing for having my dog which they knew about, on the property. Just gonna state here that she was apart of my agreement because she‚Äôs going to be a service dog for me. They‚Äôve now changed there minds 4 months later &amp; saying that I can stay but she can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm basically being forced to be homeless &amp; no one really seems to care. I‚Äôve been reaching out to those I love... but nothing. All too busy or something better. I know they say don‚Äôt give up, it‚Äôll get there but when? For the past 2 years I had cancer, after I found out I was in remission &amp; this program a youth organisation had accepted me, the Australian bush fires started which effected my family home. I lost my granddad as well now they‚Äôre doing this. Just when is it gonna end
