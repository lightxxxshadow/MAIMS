Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  They're basically all friendly towards me until I talk about my feelings and depression and then they're like  Oh you're depressed? Bye  it's not even that people just don't want to deal with me, whether its my close friends that I used to open up too. (Found out quickly that they weren't close to me at all because they all left me) The worst part is is that when girls talk about their depression or their anxiety people are like  Awww do you want someone to talk to, are you okay?  But when guys talk about feelings our depression I just can't because I know all they would do is just pay no attention. It's so dumb. Am I the only one that thinks like this? Because I've never seen any guy open up about their  depression  if they had one they usually keep it to themselves. Even after if they've gone through break ups they never really say anything about being depressed but it's  okay  if girls are depressed.
