Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  [I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences] I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety. For the first week I was prescribed 5mg, 10mg thereafter. It's been two days and I have this mild feeling like I'm on ecstasy/MDMA. My body feels light and I have this weird concentration of energy above my neck at the back of my head. Has anyone felt this/experienced this?

No
The post does not show any indication of risk of thwarted belongingness. The individual's concerns are focused on the physical effects of the medication and whether others have experienced similar symptoms, rather than feelings of disconnection or lack of social support.

Correct
Continue carefully differentiating between the poster's description of physical sensations due to medication and the potential for psychological symptoms. It's important to base your analyses on explicit information provided rather than making assumptions.
