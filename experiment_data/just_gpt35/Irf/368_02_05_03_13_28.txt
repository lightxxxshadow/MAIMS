Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've had help from the nhs as a teenager for my mental health, specifically with anxiety in the past but I think it just made these issues worse due to the medications and the general misunderstanding I recieved from doctors. Im 18 now and feel like I need to do something because I want to die and have been depressed for almost a decade and can't see any way of things getting better. Its just terrifying because I dont think I can cope with all the drama involved in trying to get help in this country, and its only supposed to be worse as an adult. I'm really sorry cause I know its so much harder for some people in other countries. I don't really know why I'm posting, I just don't know who to talk to. I just feel really on my own and don't know what to do.

The post indicates feelings of isolation ('feel really on my own') and a lack of support ('don't know who to talk to'). These factors suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is one of the components of suicide risk.
