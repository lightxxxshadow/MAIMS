Post:
  Hey guys, I'm lost. Quick introduction. I've had four heart attacks due to bad genetics and i'm only 25, and i need to know what i need to do next. I'm so miserable, I have fallen into deep dark severe depression of emotionless days that plagued me since 22. What would you do? I am sitting here drunk as all else, and every year has become a tipping point of despair.
