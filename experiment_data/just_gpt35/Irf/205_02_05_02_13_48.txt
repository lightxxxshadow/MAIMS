Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Got into an argument with my partner a couple days ago and haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it. I have severe depression, not medicated because i don‚Äôt have insurance, but I see a volunteer therapist every couple weeks. I live with my partner, we‚Äôve been together for a little over a year. Partner is getting depressed because they feel like all they do is make me feel better. I feel so selfish because I can‚Äôt help them help me. I feel worthless and like a burden and I just wish I could find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning without bothering them. How do I help myself, so my partner won‚Äôt resent me in a few years? I‚Äôm so afraid of losing them because of my mental illness
