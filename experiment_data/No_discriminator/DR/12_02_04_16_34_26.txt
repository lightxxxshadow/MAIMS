Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Does everyone else just hurt all the time It’s not like physical pain or soreness, it’s just this overwhelming feeling of exhaustion and numbness. Doing anything, from applying for jobs to walking my dog, is just so overwhelmingly exhausting and it feels like running a marathon. I’ve tried everything - exercise, diet, meditation, meds. Nothing is working. Exercise just makes me tired. I’ve never gotten that rush of endorphins. I don’t have any hobbies that make me happy or that I can even focus on long enough to distract me. Every day is a huge ordeal
