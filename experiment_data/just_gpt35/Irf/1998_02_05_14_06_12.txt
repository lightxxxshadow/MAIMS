True Label:	Yes
Post:
  You‚Äôve probably haven‚Äôt heard from me since I made that concerning post awhile ago, then me deleting it. Welp I‚Äôm alive still, but I was very close to ending it today. My head was spiraling more than I‚Äôve ever felt, and light started to blur and noise was distorted. Keep in mind, I wasn‚Äôt dying or gaining out of consciousness, I was just walking around my school and I heard the noise of a helicopter, while the sunset was gleaming in my eye. I was just trying to find that damn helicopter since that noise was just consuming me, and my whole world was vanishing, and I lost my meaning completely. I just wanted to end it. I didn‚Äôt know how, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be alive tomorrow. My mind was gone. I then sat down and cried. Through the hole of the tables outside, I saw a pair of converse. While crying and trying to hide my tears from the cheer team that just got back from practice, I saw friend‚Äôs converse who had just came back from 711. They were surprised to see me there, and gave me the rest of their iced coffee. They didn‚Äôt know I was crying since I played it off that I was sleeping. We spent another 30 minutes eating brownies and talking about our day. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever appreciated a person so much in my life. I never knew that the person who saved me would be the one I would least expect. I owe them my life.
