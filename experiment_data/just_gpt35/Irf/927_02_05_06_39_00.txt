Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I told a couple friends I was considering suicide,they looked worried. Some people gotta care,right? I have not killed myself yet because I was thinking how it would affect them. They care,even if they don't talk to me a lot and I'm an idiot. If it wasn't for them I woul probably be hanging in the closet

The post indicates that the person believes they are a burden to others and that their suicide would affect their friends. This suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a common factor in suicidal ideation.
