Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I really want to stop myself from watching porn.. I'm a 19 years old girl, never been with a guy, only with a woman. I consider myself bisexual. I've been watching porn since 9 or I think much more younger than that. I grew up on a terrible family. During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing.. When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it. It made me feel arouse when someone is groping me and I dont know why. That's why in porn, I'm being aroused as well with groping or.. force or worst gang sex whatever they call that. I used to masturbate and still masturbating for it. I dont know why am I so into it even if I know that porn industry is evil and I dont ever want to be raped. I dont want casual sex as well.. but still I find myself masturbating to it and being so aroused by it. That's one of the things that depressing me. I want to stop myself from masturbating, I want to stop myself from watching porn.. thing is now, I'm on a long distance relationship and she's into kinky stuff.. i just dont know what to do anymore I just want to end everything.. I never had good, peaceful life since I was young.. I'm so dirty, I am so dirty. I just wanna sleep forever

The post indicates a sense of burden and shame, as the individual expresses a desire to stop watching porn but feels unable to control their urges. They also mention past experiences of being groped and feeling aroused by it, which may contribute to feelings of dirtiness and self-blame. The statement about wanting to sleep forever suggests a level of despair and hopelessness, further emphasizing the perceived burdensomeness.
