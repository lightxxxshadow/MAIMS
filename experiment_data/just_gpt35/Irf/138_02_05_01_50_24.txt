Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel like all my emotions are fake, and everything I say is a lie because of it. I feel like my bad days are just fake and in my mind, and anything I like is garbage that I'm not really interested in, I end up feeling like I don't really love friends and family. I just end up hating myself because of these feelings and feeling even more detached from the world. Why do I have to sabotage my own mind and feelings?

The poster's feelings of detachment, feeling like emotions are fake, and questioning the love for friends and family indicate a potential risk of thwarted belongingness.
