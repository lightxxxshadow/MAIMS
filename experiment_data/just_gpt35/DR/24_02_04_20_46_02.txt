Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Does anyone else get such intrusive thoughts like “I hate myself, I should cut myself, I wanna die” that are so intense you have to say it out loud? Sometimes when I get into a cycle of negative thoughts they are so strong and it’s just automatic that I say it out loud. Sometimes if just comes out as an “oh my god” but other times I actually say those thoughts to myself. Physically telling myself that I’m stupid, I have no worth, I wish I could die. Does anyone feel this compulsive need to say their thoughts out loud?
