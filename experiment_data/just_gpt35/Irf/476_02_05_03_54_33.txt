Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I finally decided after several attempts on my life that this will be the last one. Theres an overpass for a busy interstate by my house. The height and speed of the cars should be enough to take me out once and for all. I'm so god damn alone and I feel guilty that people care about me. All i have to keep me going is my dog but I dont think she'll stop me this time. I'm a total fuck up who's ruined every positive thing in his life. I'm 17 and have no future no will to live. It's been this way everyday for over three years. My times come and I'm not afraid to say goodbye anymore.
