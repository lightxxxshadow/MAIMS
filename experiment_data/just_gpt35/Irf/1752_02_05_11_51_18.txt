Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  You guys ever been tossed aside like last month‚Äôs trash? Not a great feeling, especially when you already feel fucking worthless. My particular instance of this is made even worse by the fact that this situation arose from a douchebag throwing tons of money at the target of my affection. I don‚Äôt know where the money comes from, but it‚Äôs in large enough quantities that I have a suspicion the douchebag in question has some rich parents and hasn‚Äôt earned any of this affluence himself. It‚Äôs a real piss-off. I suppose what I should take away from this situation is that the girl in question is a money-grubbing whore. When I did have some disposable cash she was really sweet and affectionate. Not anymore since this fuckface entered the scenario. I‚Äôm really fucking fed up with this. I guess I need to just move on and write this girl off as what she‚Äôs presented herself to be now, an entitled, money-obsessed bitch. Any insight would be helpful.
