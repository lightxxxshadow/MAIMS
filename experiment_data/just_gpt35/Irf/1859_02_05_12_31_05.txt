Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It all started in fifth grade.. It was there I realized what was loneliness and being an outcast. I feel like an outcast honestly everywhere and I feel like garbage of who I am. From 5th grade to (currently)10th grade I have been becoming more and more depressed. At first it just started as sadness from time to time but around 9th grade it really kicked into overdrive. Its gotten to the point where I don't truly laugh anymore or anything not even my own family make me genuinely happy. To make matters worse I probably don't have it as bad as some people here but idk why I can't get that through my head...anyways have a happy new years everyone.. Heres to another year of depression lol.

The post indicates a sense of feeling like an outcast, low self-esteem, and worsening depression. The mention of not feeling genuinely happy anymore and comparing one's struggles to others suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness.
