Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  School starts again for me tomorrow (in less than 9 hours) and frankly, there's no reason for me to go. I got into some complications regarding my self-harm the day before the break started, so I don't really feel like walking into a trap. Plus, the one person I can talk to about it doesn't come to school on Wednesdays, meaning I really have to reason to drag myself out of bed tomorrow. I'm getting really depressed just thinking about it. Someone help me find motivation...

The post indicates a lack of social support and a feeling of isolation, as the poster mentions not having anyone to talk to about their self-harm and feeling trapped by going to school. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a mental health concept that refers to feeling disconnected from others and lacking a sense of social inclusion or support.
