Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm 16 and I have had frequent thoughts about dieing and killing myself. I think of new ways of doing it like cutting and hanging and stuff and have cut my self a lot. I have had a rough childhood and recently something awful happened to me. I am lucky because I have supportive friends and family but I still feel empty and lonely. I might just do it soon...
