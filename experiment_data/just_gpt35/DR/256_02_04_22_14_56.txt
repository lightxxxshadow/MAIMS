Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  In major distress because of my appearance This is something I've struggled with for so long, I don't know if I'll ever get over it. Just when I think I feel      ok     with myself I look go look into the mirror and see a monster staring back at me. Don't even get me started on cell photos. No matter what angles I take or if I'm wearing make up I look horrible. I analyze all my facial features and compare them to conventionally attractive women, I know everything that's wrong with my face and why I'll never be called beautiful or sexy or even cute. I guess this must explain why I'm gawked at so much in public. Imagining what I must look like from someone elses point of view makes me feel ill. I'll never be effortlessly beautiful. I lost the genetic lottery. I'm reminded of this whenever I see photos or gifs of young female models. My DNA is wrong. I don't know what I did to deserve this. I don't even have enough money to get cosmetic surgery. I hate this.
