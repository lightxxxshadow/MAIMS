Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  i feel like absolute trash and my depression and anxiety are completely controlling me and i have zero control over them. i don‚Äôt *want* to kill myself but i can‚Äôt help but think i would be better off dead. everything is just too hard. i‚Äôm 26, will turn 27 this coming year, and i live at home and don‚Äôt have a college degree. i have a part-time job and struggle to even get through 4 hour shifts. so i don‚Äôt make enough money to do anything but attend work basically and smoke some cigarettes. i have 1 or maybe 2 ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends but i don‚Äôt see them often because i isolate in my depression. i know my family is so disappointed and fed up with me. i‚Äôm also struggling with a severely broken heart from an on-and-off 10 year thing and i‚Äôm realizing now that this person wants nothing to do with me in their life even though i love them more than anything. i don‚Äôt know how to get myself out of this rut. i go to therapy weekly and see a psychiatrist for meds and nothing is improving my mental state or motivation. i‚Äôve been in Partial Hospitalization something like 5 times over the past 4-5 years. should i just pack a bag and book myself inpatient?

The post indicates feelings of isolation and being disconnected from others, with the individual mentioning having only one or two 'real' friends that they rarely see. They also express disappointment from their family and feeling like a burden. These factors suggest a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, where the person feels a lack of social connection and belongingness in their life.
