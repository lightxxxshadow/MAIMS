True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Besides the fact that a lot of people i considered friends didnt even remember , now i have reached extremes levels of my anxiety because i have to invite friends over for a party otherwise they'll think im weird or i dont want to hang out with them. I dont enjoy parties mainly cause i'm poor and i cant organise one properly , also i just have high anxiety when too many people are around me. I dont want to lose the last friends i have but i dont know what to do. sorry if this post doesnt fit or whatever i just wanted to express whats on my mind thank you for your attention. also sorry for the bad english
