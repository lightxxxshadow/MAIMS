The poster expresses a need to talk to someone, suggesting a feeling of loneliness or isolation. They also seek distraction through music, movies, or TV shows, which could be a way of avoiding negative thoughts or emotions. This craving for distraction and potential difficulty in managing their own emotional state may indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.
