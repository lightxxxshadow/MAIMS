  How To Befriend Someone I Had An Awkward Past With? I had this female friend that I met almost two years ago. Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that. After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do? Some might say that I should leave it behind, but I did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life I have never met someone so true, genuine and wholesome in my life so I cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me. Would appreciate hearing from you people by assisting me. Thanks a bunch! :) &lt;3

Yes
The poster's answers on the mental scale indicate that they often feel sad, discouraged, and have a sense of past failure. They also experience guilt and self-dislike. These responses suggest the presence of depressive symptoms and indicate that the poster may be suffering from depression.

Correct
Continue to analyze the provided evidence critically, avoid overgeneralizations, and be cautious not to infer beyond what the data indicates. Remember to differentiate between the subject's own mental health and the mental health of others when analyzing posts and scales.
