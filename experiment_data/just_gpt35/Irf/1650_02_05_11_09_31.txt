True Label:	No
Post:
  That's so embarrassing, humiliating and so frustrating especially on these last days of holidays. I mean, this person is with his/her loved one, people she cares about. Why do I even think about this person. It's infuriating and making this thread is giving her more attention than this one person deserve from me.
