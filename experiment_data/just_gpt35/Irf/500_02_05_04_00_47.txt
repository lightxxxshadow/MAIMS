Post:
  This has been happening to me recently. The dreams are very vivid and it feels like I‚Äôm back in that time. My child years were pretty decent. It feels like I‚Äôm in a different realm/world now because of mental illness which is primarily depression and dissociation.

The post mentions feeling in a different realm/world due to mental illness, which indicates a sense of disconnection and isolation. This can be a manifestation of thwarted belongingness, where the individual feels unable to connect with others and experiences a lack of social support.
