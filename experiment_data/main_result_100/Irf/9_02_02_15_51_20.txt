Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Help? I'm just feeling really shitty at how I seem to have spent the majority of my time recently lying around not doing anything, letting my room and shit get into a mess and just been consumed by negative thoughts. I'm also worse at a particular time of day. Like I've barely done anything productive this month and I hate myself for it, and I hate the fact I can't try hard enough/be bothered to help myself out of this. Some days are better than others, yes, but at the end of the day I just can't do it. I'm 17 and wasting my fucking life being lazy and doing nothing, the new year has made me realise. I want to make resolutions but I know I can't keep them so I'm not bothering. Any help/advice??

####################################
Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
Based on the poster's response to the mental scale questions, they indicate that they feel somewhat disconnected from other people, rarely interact with people who care about them, and perceive themselves as making things worse for others. These feelings suggest a sense of perceived burdensomeness, as the poster believes they are a burden on society and that their absence would be a relief to the people in their life.

Incorrect
Be careful not to infer feelings of burdensomeness without clear evidence. The poster did express feelings of low self-worth and acknowledged some issues with motivation and productivity, but the answered mental health scale questions do not support a conclusion of perceived burdensomeness. Instead, focus on the specific answers given. The poster acknowledged feeling disconnected and having some difficult interactions, but did not agree with statements about being a burden on society or that their death would be a relief to others. Try to differentiate between general feelings of self-dissatisfaction and specific feelings related to perceived burdensomeness.

ITER 1
No
The poster's response to the mental health scale questions does not indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness. Although they express feelings of low self-worth and struggles with motivation and productivity, they do not agree with statements about being a burden on society or that their death would be a relief to others. It is important to differentiate between general feelings of self-dissatisfaction and specific feelings related to burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Consider the answered questions where the poster does express concerns that are somewhat true for them, such as feeling disconnected and having more negative thoughts at certain times of the day. These responses indicate elements of perceived burdensomeness, despite not explicitly agreeing with the more severe statements. Avoid minimizing signs that may still contribute to a risk of perceived burdensomeness, and re-evaluate the post and the scales with attention to subtler expressions of the construct.

ITER 2
Yes
The post indicates feelings of self-hatred, being consumed by negative thoughts, and feeling like a burden on society. Additionally, the poster expresses concern about wasting their life and not being motivated to help themselves. These statements align with elements of perceived burdensomeness, as indicated by the somewhat true responses on the mental scale questions related to feeling disconnected, rarely interacting with caring people, and having people to turn to in times of need.

Incorrect
Avoid assuming negative characteristics without explicit evidence. The response suggesting the poster feels like a burden on society is not supported by the answers given to the mental health scale questions, which largely indicate that they do not perceive themselves as a burden. Re-assess the information provided, focusing on the facts, and avoid reading into the answers. Ensure alignment between the self-reported feelings in the post and the answers provided in the mental scale questions when making your final determination.

ITER 3
No
The poster's responses to the mental health scale questions do not indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness. They do not believe that they are a burden on society or that their death would be a relief to others. Additionally, they believe that there are people they can turn to in times of need. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the poster perceives themselves as a burden on others.

Correct
Review the answers to the mental health scale questions more carefully, pay close attention to the language used in the post and the individual's responses to the scale questions, looking for hints of self-devaluation or feelings of being a burden. Ensure that you are not disregarding subtle signs of perceived burdensomeness in the respondent's answers and self-description in the post.
