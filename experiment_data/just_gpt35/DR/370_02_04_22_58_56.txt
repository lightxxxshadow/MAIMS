Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  The moment of clarity I've had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem. Throughout my entire lifetime, my thoughts have been so warped that I just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience. It sounds so stupid typing things out. The moment I realized that my mental illness was  real  was coming to the conclusion that well-adjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis. And with that, came my wake up call to get help..
