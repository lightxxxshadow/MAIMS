Post:
  Does anyone want to just exchange some compliments? Hey! I know a lot of you are having a rough time out there, and some of you are having one of those nights where things aren't looking too good. I'm having one of those right now. I think we can all benefit from just a session of telling each other the truth, that we all matter. We are all beautiful. We are all worth it. I'm going to post this and go to sleep, but I promise you all that I will respond to each and every person who comments when I wake up. I love you guys! Feel free to start without me :p

The poster's mention of having a rough time and one of those nights where things aren't looking too good suggests a possible experience of depressive symptoms. Additionally, the desire for compliments and the need for validation from others can be indicative of low self-esteem often associated with depression.
