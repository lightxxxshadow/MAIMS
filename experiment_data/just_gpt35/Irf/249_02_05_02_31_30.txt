Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Quick background... 4 year relationship ended about two months ago. Madly depressed because of it. Irresponsible of me to say that I was not taking my antidepressants until recently. But I can feel myself getting worse. Lately i have struggled with holding conversations. Today I could not leave my bed. I have started searching for a therapist. Is my body going to permanently change because of the prolonged severity?
