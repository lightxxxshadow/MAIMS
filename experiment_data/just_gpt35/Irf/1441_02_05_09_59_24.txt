Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hi everyone I'm new to this sub but I just need some help with my change. For two years I have been actively self harming whether it was cutting or doing other bad stuff. I had friends that tried to help but I could never get myself to stop. Recently I found myself in a really positive relationship and because I love my boyfriend, I agreed to give him my blades and he promised he would keep them out of reach. I did this because I feel okay knowing they still exist even if I can't get to them. I could never get myself to throw them away. But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury. For anyone who has successfully quit cutting, how did you do it? Because right now, two weeks in, I only feel so much worse.

The post indicates the individual's reliance on self-harm as a coping mechanism and expresses a sense of feeling worse after stopping. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the person feels like a burden to others and may experience feelings of guilt or shame for relying on their relationship as a means of quitting self-harm.
