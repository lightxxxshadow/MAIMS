Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I never go out anymore. I work from home and I don't really have anyone to talk to at all. It's such a weird feeling to be isolated and silent all of the time. It's been like this for years, I can't tell whether I'm tired enough but I might fall asleep soon after posting this. But then again, I might not.
