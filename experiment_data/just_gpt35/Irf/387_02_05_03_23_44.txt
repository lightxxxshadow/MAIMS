Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I was doing so good, the birds all sang in the morning, the aroma of the flowers; I had not been enticed by that smell in such a long time. I had managed to clean my room; got rid of the giant stack of clothes, the water bottle collection and opened up the curtains to let the sun radiate my small lumpy mattress. Lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks from eating right and hitting the gym. Went out of my way to interact with people, like I used to love. I was planning to make a cheesecake with my niece and make strawberry flowers. Then I realized how pointless all THIS is. I‚Äôm NEVER going to be happy. I guess that‚Äôs just how it goes. Like a swing, bro. Now I‚Äôm here indecisive on whether to buy the poison that has released me from the shackles of existence countless other times or return to my prison cell and ‚Äúface it like a man‚Äù. Either way there is no way out.
