The poster's statement about feeling irrelevant, having no friends, no family, no relationships, and being labelled as a loser in modern society indicate feelings of hopelessness, loneliness, and worthlessness, which are common symptoms of depression. The mention of receiving advice to kill oneself adds further concerns regarding their mental well-being.
