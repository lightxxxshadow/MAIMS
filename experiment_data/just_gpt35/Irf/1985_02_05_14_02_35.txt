True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel like a lot less bad things would happen to people around me if I wasn‚Äôt around. I feel like a burden. I feel like I just always end up causing bad things to happen to everyone around me, which I try -so- hard to prevent. But even the things that are out of my control, still feel like they wouldn‚Äôt have happened, if I wasn‚Äôt around to cause that string of events to happen. And I always blame myself.
