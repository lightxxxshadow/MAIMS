Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I got in two car-totaling wrecks in the final two weeks of 2018. Firstly, I rear-ended someone hard enough to total my mother's car (it was still completely drivable but FUCK ME, right Geico? :); this happened the 19th. Then, I got a rental. And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead. I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to. For everyone else I've just been putting aside my fear and pain and anguish and self-doubt and I've been putting it into my work, finding extra hours and working for bonus etc. Hopefully I'll find a way out of this. Sorry for rambling. I don't want to tell this to anyone else. They just won't listen because both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver despite an otherwise squeaky-clean driving record of four years. I don't know what sign the lord, should he exist, is trying to send me. Maybe it's just to stay off of the road.
