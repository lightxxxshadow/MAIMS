True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Finding help Dealing with problems by yourself is hard. I can’t go to my family with my problems, they are in denial. My family is wealthy, I have a good job, I am getting my degree in math and kicking ass at it too. Nobody fucking believes me, thst 20 year olds like me can have problems I just need someone to talk to I guess. Ive been depressed and had bad anxiety before, but not to the point where it is now where I have attacks at work and even tear up sometimes. I feel like I’m going crazy. It’s all because of one girl. Amazing what one beautiful women can do to you. We talk everyday but I can’t help but feel like she thinks I’m a joke. The worst part is, I work with her...
