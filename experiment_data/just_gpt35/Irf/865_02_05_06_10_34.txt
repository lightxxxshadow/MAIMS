Post:
  Um, so I'm 13 and I have depression and anxiety, but I'm only on medication for anxiety until I get my depression medication later. So, recently, I feel like my depression has been making me dumber. I can't remember how to spell anything and I struggle to hear what people are trying to tell me and what it means. I can't do school work good anymore, which worry's me. I was one of the best in my class at english work, but now I'm failing because it's getting to difficult to spell and interpret things. I don't know what to do..
