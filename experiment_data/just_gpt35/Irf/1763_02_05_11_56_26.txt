The post indicates feelings of loneliness, fear, and a belief that nobody knows the person exists. These thoughts and emotions can contribute to a perceived burdensomeness, where the individual may feel like they are a burden to others and their existence holds no value. Perceived burdensomeness is often associated with depression, social isolation, and thoughts of self-harm or suicide.
