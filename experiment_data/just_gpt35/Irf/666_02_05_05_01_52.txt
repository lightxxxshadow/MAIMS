Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Not sure how to start this. So ill start by telling a few things about my life. I am a 23 years old male, living in brazil, currently working with IT. My parents and my girlfriend are really supportive and i don't really have big problems in my life, which leads to the big issue: i feel like complete shit. Despite having a job, a car, a girlfriend, a place with people that i know that love me that i can call home, i still feel like complete shit and knowing these things and not understanding why i feel like this makes me feel even worse. I have tried suicide in the past and these thoughts are behind me, but the feeling of being worthless and that im not accomplishing anything haunt me everyday. I would appreciate some help on this. Thank you and Sorry for the rant.
