Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Everyone ends up hating me eventually. My psychologist of almost ten years blew up at me and kicked me out of my last session. I‚Äôm doubting every interaction I have with every person I meet. I‚Äôm doubting every interaction I have with every single one of my friends. I can‚Äôt get my substance bias issues under control. I‚Äôm my own worst enemy. I was accused of being a bully and was subsequently bullied by the workplace bullying system. I uprooted my life to change for the better and as part of the domino of doing so my dog was killed. I would give anything to be a different person right now. To not have to be my awful, repulsive, contemptible self.
