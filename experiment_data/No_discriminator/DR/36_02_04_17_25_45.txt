Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  does it ever feel like your friends arent really there? I genuinely care for and love my friends so I regularly ask them how they're doing on messenger since they all live so far away. I know my friends struggle with depression so I make it a point to contact them and let them know I'm here for them. But most times I am left on  read  or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They don't really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I'm doing. I hope I don't sound selfish in any way, but it just feels weird to care so much for people who don't seem to care that much for you. It hurts sometimes that I also struggle with depression but have no one to talk to..
