Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Everything is just a matter of going through the motions, why do I bother even going through them? I realize everyday I am a more hollow person as everyday passes. Nobody even cared enough to wish me a happy new year, not a single family member or friend. Why does everyone shun me? I'm not an unkind person, I try to always go out of my way yet nothing is reciprocated ever. I don't see myself making it to 2019 at this rate. I don't care about anything at this point, I just need a way out of this. I need a way out of daily despair and anguish as to why nobody wants to spend any time trying to talk to me at all.
