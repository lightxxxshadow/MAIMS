True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Eating healthy, exercising, socializing, cleaning, meditating, getting sunlight, talking to a therapist, etc. None of them have made a noticeable difference in how I feel, and I'm tired of trying to do them all when it's just more adding to my struggle.

The poster mentions various activities they have tried such as eating healthy, exercising, socializing, cleaning, meditating, getting sunlight, and talking to a therapist, but states that none of them have made a noticeable difference in how they feel. This suggests a potential lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in their relationships and connections with others, indicating a risk of thwarted belongingness.
