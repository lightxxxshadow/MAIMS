Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  There are very few songs that strike a chord with my for being sad enough anymore? SO many songs are entirely about breakups and sadness surrounding that, but I'm not sad about that? I don't know if this makes any sense - but it almost feels like there isn't much music relatable to how low and depressed I am over life?
