Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I called out of work today, and no I wasn't hung over from a night of partying. I was working until 11 last night. In the last two days I worked 30 hours, and in the next two days I'm working 21. I've been extremely depressed lately to the point where I found myself seriously considering suicide. I've been in a really bad place and haven't had the time to process any of what I've been dealing with. But I still feel really guilty and like I'm a bad employee. I'm really scared of my boss or coworkers hating me. I've never taken a day off before, and I feel like I really do need it. Plus, there are some people at my work who call out pretty often and nobody seems to care. So why am I so stressed and scared about this? Am I wrong to call out?
