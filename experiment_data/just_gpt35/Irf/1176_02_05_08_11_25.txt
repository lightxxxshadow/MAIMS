Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Concentrating hurts Contemplating works Half life no life No time more lines Suffering from design Can I press rewind What would I find? Life gives you lemon and limes Pennies and dimes Struggle for the grind Can I leave it all behind What would I find? Time doesn't exist Hurts to be a realist Want to be the best End up feeling the worst Energy in bursts How does my mind work It's in control of me Puppet on a string Am I sealed to my destiny Nothing real with reality Mindless obsession over celebrities Fuck you, fuck me Nothing in this life is for free
