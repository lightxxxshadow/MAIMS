Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm taking jobs. I'm making a video game. Hell, I'm even getting married this fall. We plan to honeymoon in Japan, and I've been no-less-seriously-than-usual kicking around the idea of wandering into the Aokigahara while we're there and never walking out. I'm also semi-seriously making career / retirement plans, and thinking about the futures of my parents and niblings and sister and in-laws. But none of this has any substantial meaning to me. It's just shit that might need to be taken care of before my depression-disease becomes terminal. I'm empty inside, and like skipping rocks on a bottomless lake, I'm just keeping myself amused by throwing pointless nothings into the void. /melodrama
