True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm pretty sure I'm depressed but my parents don't believe in mental health and I'm too afraid to like go to a school counselor cuz my parents will ground me for just wanting attention or something. I wanna get better but I don't think I can without help of some sort. people say that meds suck and therapists suck and stuff but I feel like anything Is better than how I feel. I feel I need help but I don't know how to get it
