Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Was freaking out yesterday, broke crap and screamed and cussed about his money problems and stuff, then calmed down. Well he‚Äôs back at it again today. Saying I don‚Äôt do anything around the house, and admitted that my brother has apparently been texting him and talk crap about me behind my back as well. Saying that I should do more to help out cause he apparently thinks I can keep up by myself with our two story house and doesn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm depressed cause he‚Äôs an idiot. Then my dad start screaming about how I‚Äôm making his life hard and how I should just leave. And that he‚Äôs gonna start charging me rent and if I can‚Äôt afford I can get out of his house. I have work in a few hours and I don‚Äôt think I can go. Not only cause I need him for a ride but how am I supposed to function at work after this. I‚Äôm literally holding one of my dads handguns in my lap that he gave me for self defense if ever needed. I‚Äôve never thought so hard or wanted so bad to just quit being a wimp and pull the trigger? Should I? I don‚Äôt see a point in going on. If I do, I‚Äôll just have to go through this all over again. I want it over. I‚Äôm also thinking of sending a photo to my brother, at least to scare the crap out of him. Maybe then he‚Äôll think twice before talking behind my back to a man who‚Äôs mentally unstable again.

The post indicates feelings of isolation, being attacked by family members, and considering self-harm as a response to the distressing situation. These factors suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological state characterized by a perceived lack of social connection or support.
