Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  She told me she would have married me. I thought I needed to gender transition. It all fell to pieces. I don't need to get back together with her. I just wish I knew how she was doing. I wish I could see her and tell her that with some time, I understand what she was going through. But she's the sensitive type and I think contacting her would upset her. So I can't. Pathetic, I know.
