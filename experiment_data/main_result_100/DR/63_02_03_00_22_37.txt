Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So I finally realized something this week... Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void. I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's responses to the questions of the mental scale indicate a high level of depressive symptoms. They express sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, self-dislike, self-accusations, worthlessness, loss of energy, changes in sleeping pattern, irritability, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, and changes in interest in sex. These responses are consistent with criteria for a diagnosis of depression.

Incorrect
Re-assess the provided responses without adding unfounded characteristics or negative traits. Focus only on the information given in the post and the answers to the mental health scale questions. Avoid speculating about unmentioned aspects of the poster's life or personality. Accurately distinguishing between the feelings and situations of the poster and others mentioned in the post is crucial. Do not attribute the mental health of the people around the poster to the poster themselves. Remember to base your conclusions strictly on the evidence provided.

ITER 1
Yes
The poster's post and their responses to the mental health scale suggest symptoms of depression, such as feeling sad, discouraged, having low self-esteem, loss of pleasure, lack of energy, changes in sleeping pattern and appetite, difficulty concentrating, and feeling worthless.

Correct
The student's analysis is accurately reflective of the responses to the mental health scale, and there are no instances of over-inference. When diagnosing, continue to rely on evidence from the subject's own reported feelings and behaviors, rather than making assumptions beyond what the data suggests.
