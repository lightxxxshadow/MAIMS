Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Another day of nobody at home understanding the underlying reasons I do things . Why I sleep so much, why I'm in my room all the time, why I eat so much. I sleep so I don't have to deal with things. I'm in my room so I don't bother people. I eat so much because food is the one of the few things that make me happy anymore. I put on the facade for everyone that I'm this optimistic, happy go lucky person, but if people really knew. And God forbid I tell my mom I have depression. She'd yell and tell me I don't. I know somethings wrong. I have something, depression, BPD, ADHD, something! But I'm too poor to be diagnosed and too scared to ever confide in family, to only be told I'm saying this because I want attention. And every day I have to pretend I'm ok.

The poster expresses feeling misunderstood and a sense of burden on others. They mention sleeping to avoid dealing with issues, isolating themselves in their room, and using food as a coping mechanism. They also mention putting on a facade of being optimistic and happy but feeling like they have to pretend to be okay. The mention of being too scared to confide in family and the fear of being told they just want attention indicates a perceived burdensomeness.
