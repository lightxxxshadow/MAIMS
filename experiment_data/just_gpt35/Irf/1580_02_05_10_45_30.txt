Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through. I just need to know of anyone who has been this bad and came back. What meds have worked for you, what have you done to get yourself out of this? I had a difficult childhood too and therapy has brought up a ton of emotional baggage that's contributing to my mental state.
