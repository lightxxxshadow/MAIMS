Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I sometimes have this strange feeling that I cant seem to place. Its like the room expands and turns black. Whether Im alone or in with people doesnt seem to matter. At that moment Im alone in a large dark room. The question here is, does anybody know what this might be? (Yeahyeah I know professional hell blabla)

The feeling described by the poster of being alone in a large dark room even when they are with people can indicate a sense of isolation and disconnection. This may suggest that the post shows a potential risk of thwarted belongingness.
