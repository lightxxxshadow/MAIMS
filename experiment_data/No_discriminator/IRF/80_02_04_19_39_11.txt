Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôve sat in a dark room for 5 hours staring at a wall, doing nothing. Yet I still felt as bored as if I were to just watch Netflix or play games. I feel bored and scared. Scared that I lost my mind and will never be normal again.

The post indicates feelings of disconnectedness, feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and rarely interacting with people who care about the person. These factors suggest a possible risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a key element in assessing mental health problems.
