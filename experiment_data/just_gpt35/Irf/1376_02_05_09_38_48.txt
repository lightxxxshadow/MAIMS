Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Last year I thought I finally got over my depression and anxiety, but then my girlfriend cheated on me, broke up with me, and told me I wasn‚Äôt good enough for her. It all came back into my life, I did countless drugs which only made my depression worse, I had a comedown that lasted one week and I never spent more time thinking about suicide on a genuine level than ever. I‚Äôve stopped the drugs, they were bad for me, but they‚Äôve affected me long term now even more than I already had been affected by my depression and anxiety.

The post indicates feelings of rejection and a lack of acceptance from the girlfriend, which can lead to a sense of thwarted belongingness. The mention of drugs and suicidal thoughts also suggests a worsening of mental health issues.
