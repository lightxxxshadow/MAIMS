Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Just ranting. It fucking annoys me when I tell someone I’m depressed and they say “why.” Like, when someone tells you they have the fucking flu do you ask why? How are people so dumb about mental illness? I have people who say “yeah, I was depressed before,” and I’m like “what did you do” and they say it just went away. Seriously? You just woke up and it was fucking gone? Poof? Everyone always has their golden fix for me too. My mom tells me to drink lemon water. My dad says “stop worrying so much.” My coworker says “meditate.” Exercise. Volunteer. Quit your job and go do what you love (which is what, exactly?). I try so, so, so hard to not be depressed. But if I’m not pushing myself 120% to stop it, it comes back, and I’m back to square one. And I can’t, I just can’t keep doing it. It’s just like pushing a rock up a mountain with no peak. My favorite are the people who say “you need to let go. Just let go of the past.” These are the people that post dumbass quotes on Facebook and Instagram who haven’t experienced a day of depression in their lives. Let go of WHAT? What does that even fucking mean? I ask these people to go into detail, and they don’t. They act like a fucking monk, and just say, “You just have to let go.” All of those people can go fuck themselves.

Yes
The poster's ranting about feeling depressed along with the mentioned symptoms such as sadness, pessimism, loss of pleasure, agitation, difficulty in making decisions, worthlessness, and lack of energy are consistent with the symptoms of depression.

Correct
Ensure to avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information and to always differentiate between the subject of the post and the people around them. Continue to cross-reference symptoms with reliable mental health scales for accurate assessments.
