Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Except to use the bathroom. I have no motivation to do anything. I'm on a waiting list to see a therapist so I feel like I'm just waiting for that. I've been double dosing on medication (metrazapine) to help me sleep excessively. Not sure what I want from this post just wanted to vent. Thanks.
