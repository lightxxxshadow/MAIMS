Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Friends, On a throwaway here for now. I had to write/speak to someone so I've decided here is the best place. With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience. A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing! Now I'm desperately struggling to keep happy and I have this low to medium level of anxiety that just won't go away no matter how hard I try and think differently. I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home. The annoying thing is, 6 months ago, I wouldn't care less about being away from home! Or spending time alone! How do I go about just getting my resilience back and being able to deal with things? I wish wish wish I could be like, oh, so I have to fly out on Monday, big deal, I'll be back soon, make the most of it! I just want this anxiety to go away and leave me in peace! Thanks for listening.
