Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I don't have the motivation for anything anymore. I just don't. Not even for the things that i love. I've always struggled with depression, i've had it for like 6 years now. But lately for some reason it has gotten really bad, to the point that i can't even live my life anymore. I can't concentrate on school, i don't feel like talking to people, i don't feel like replying to messages. I don't even feel like crying anymore, i just feel like a mess. All i do everyday now is listen to music, listen to music and daydream. Daydream of all the things that i really want to do, but i just can't find the motivation to actually do. I feel lost. I really don't even know where i stand anymore.
