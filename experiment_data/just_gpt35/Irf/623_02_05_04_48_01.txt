Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  The person I love is also depressed. A few weeks ago, they had a short hospital stay for reasons. Since they got out, they've been an entirely different person. Today my depression was referred to as a man period. Two stupid little words. Fucking hurt. If I had ever said anything like that to her about hers, Id be ashamed of myself. I think she's pushing me away so I'll break it off and she can move on guilt free. I don't know what the FUCK to do anymore. I haven't had friends in years. There's no one to talk to.

The post suggests that the person is feeling like a burden to their loved one who is also depressed. They mention being pushed away and the desire for the other person to break things off guilt-free. This indicates a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the poster may believe they are causing trouble and burdening their loved one with their own depressive symptoms.
