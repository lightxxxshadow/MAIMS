Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes

  How to function properly when you realize there's no such thing as life? I'm depressed but I have no sad story to tell (just an uneventful one). I fail at everything and turn everyone down mostly because I was tormented for years by the absurdity of it all. I don't care if me dying will affect anyone. Someone's  recovery from depression  doesn't concern me neither. We're just complex preprogrammed machines creating illusions to survive and reproduce, to seek pleasure according to the program. We're part of the universe and shit, cool, so what? It's not even about the pain anymore. Why keep going when life doesn't exist? But if I do stay for a while, how do I even function properly when I'm stuck with this in mind?
