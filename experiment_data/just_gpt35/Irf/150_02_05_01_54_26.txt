Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Home life is really bad at the moment, both parents are alcoholics and recently their drinking had been getting a lot worse. It's cause both sides of my family to argue due to my parents lack of care over my younger sister. I want to move out but I do not have the money, I don't really have anywhere to go, I want to call social services on my parents (again) but I can't as I'll be kicked out and have my belongings potentially trashed. My parents have never been there for me, I didn't have the best childhood, which has caused me to have an unfortunate array of mental disorders and depression. But now I'm starting to think I'll win the lottery of 1 million and everything will be okay, I keep thinking I'm going to win money and then I can move out and give me and my sister a better life for both of us. It's getting to the point that I'm daydreaming constantly of winning a large sum of money, and that I can get my own place and my sister will be okay. Ive started to genuinely think I'm a millionare. I'm that depressed I'm having unrealistic dreams and thoughts of the future so I don't think of what's happening at home and I don't know what to do. I don't get a lot of money to my self, I cannot get a job due to health/mental health reasons, even though I'd like to work. Everything is getting worse again and it feels like my brain is struggling on ways to cope with it.

The post indicates a lack of support and care from the poster's parents, resulting in feelings of isolation and disconnectedness. The desire to win a large sum of money to improve their living situation and provide a better life for themselves and their sister suggests a longing for belongingness that is not being fulfilled in their current home environment.
