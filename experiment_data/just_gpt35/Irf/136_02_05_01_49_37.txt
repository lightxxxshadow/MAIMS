Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I thought there was a small chance that I might get invited to make plans by old friends, but I should have known that wasn't gonna happen due to persisting false rumors. Now I'm stuck in my room just sad and depressed. I am 21 though, so I'm wondering if I should just go to the bar and drink a bit so at least I'm surrounded by people when the new year starts. I'm hopeful for the future, but rn I'm down as hell. I try to look my best all the time but my nerdy demeanor and social anxiety kills any interest someone might have towards me. Idk what to do.
