  Yeah, so...2017 has begun and i'm sure this depression will still kill me little by little in the inside. Will be 4 years since life became a total shit, when everything changed so bad...the same place, the same motherfucking job, no gf, not enough cash, the worst thing which is i left my studies, oh, and the same bullshit everyone tells me: Everything will be fine, it's just a bad day, at least you have good health (i wish...), you seems like you have everything in life (ugh...). Well, that's all i have to say, i just wanted to share my thoughs on this place, sorry if I offend to anyone...
