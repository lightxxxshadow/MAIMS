Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  What if I have an amazing family, and amazing boyfriend, amazing friends, amazing schooling, amazing financial status. What if I have no reason to be depressed? All of my family is coming over this afternoon to enjoy the night and I'm crying in my room, afraid and tired. But all I can think about is how tired I am of life. How nothing is bringing me joy anymore. I have no reason to live. Is anyone else feeling this way? Please PM me. I feel so done.
