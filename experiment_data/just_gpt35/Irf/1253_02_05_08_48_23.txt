Post:
  Hi. Nice to meet you. I am a loser. A complete nobody that never gets noticed by others. I feel very insecure about myself. Too ugly, too boring, too awkward. I always mess things up, don't have any true real life friends. I don't do anything, just sit in front of my tv or computer when I have free time. I am not planning on killing myself but I just don't want to live anymore. I am tired of being nothing
