Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I had a line cook job for two weeks after being unemployed for 9 months. They hired me at $14 an hour which is nice, though I wasnt any good at all. I tell them everyday how i suck or when food is sent back to be up cooked or refired i tell them sorry im retarded or sorry im actually useless and stupid. Today i no call no showed and bought beer and will drink myself to sleep tonight. They deserve a better cook one who doesnt suck and can move food through the window without upcooks. I feel bad that they payed me $14 hr when im clearly not good enough to make that much. Im gonna call n tell them tomorrow that they deserve better than what ive got to offer. I suck at everything i try which is why i sold all my video games and instruments. I just wish everyday that id never been put here on this rock to be so mediocre and useless. Im a fucking useless loser who will never amount to shit.

The post demonstrates a feeling of low self-worth and worthlessness. The poster expresses intense self-criticism, feelings of incompetence, and a belief that they do not belong or fit in. This indicates a risk of thwarted belongingness, as they perceive themselves as being inadequate and not meeting the expectations of others.
