Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Failing half my classes, same as last semester, going to drop out of college at the end of the semester with no life direction, no ambition, no motivation, no desires, dreams, will to live. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to hide the scars covering my arm during the summer when it‚Äôs 100 fucking degrees out. I‚Äôve worn short sleeve shirts my whole life almost never wearing long sleeves (not counting hoodies/coats/etc) so I‚Äôll definitely receive lots of questions if I‚Äôm sweating my ass off wearing a long sleeve shirt for no reason during hot summer days. Don‚Äôt really see a way out of this shitty life other than killing myself. Mom asked me a couple weeks ago where I see myself in 10 years. I told her I didn‚Äôt know, but all I could think was that I don‚Äôt see any scenario where I‚Äôm alive in 10 years. Might as well just off myself now before everything goes to shit... sorry... before everything gets even shittier just like it always does. Cutting my hand right now cause I know it won‚Äôt leave scars like are on my arm. Don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this. Maybe I just need to rant or get this off my chest. Maybe some part, hidden deep away inside me, actually believes typing this out will help. Nothing helps. I can distract myself from these thoughts temporarily, but ignoring the water doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not drowning.

The post indicates a feeling of being a burden to others based on statements like 'Don‚Äôt really see a way out of this shitty life other than killing myself' and 'Maybe some part, hidden deep away inside me, actually believes typing this out will help'. These thoughts suggest a sense of hopelessness, low self-worth, and a belief that others would be better off without the poster.
