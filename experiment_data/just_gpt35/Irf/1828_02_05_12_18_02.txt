Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life. However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years. **Backstory** Severely abused as kid. Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things. I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things. Learned to manage that with years of therapy. Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that. So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear. i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better. however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances). I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible. any thoughts/help/advice?

The post indicates a sense of isolation and fear of rejection or judgment from others. The individual expresses difficulty interacting with new people due to anxiety and a fear that others may perceive them as crazy or emotionally unstable. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as they feel disconnected from others and lack a sense of acceptance or worth in relationships.
