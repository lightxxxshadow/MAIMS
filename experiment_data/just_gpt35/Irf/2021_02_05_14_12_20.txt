Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  As I get set to go to bed at 6pm on NYE (the first %#&amp;$ing NYE I got off from work in years and can't find any plans), I've come to realize that this year, the holidays have done nothing but make me angry. Seeing others having fun, holiday decorations, stuff that are supposed to bring joy... did nothing but piss me off.
