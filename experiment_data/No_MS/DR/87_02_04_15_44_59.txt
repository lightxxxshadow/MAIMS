Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I’ve been abandoned by anyone I’ve ever loved. My mother emptied the bank accounts and left while I was in school one day, 20 years ago. A few years later, my father followed suit, getting sent to prison and never contacting me again. My brother lives across the country, haven’t spoken to him in years. Sister actually lives a few miles away, haven’t spoken to her in months. And recently my girlfriend of 4 years, who I was planning on proposing to, left without any warning, not even a talk. I haven’t spoken out loud to another human, barring work hours, in 3 weeks. I received my last non work related text 2 weeks ago. I keep trying to keep going, but I want to give up. I want to feel nothing. I don’t want to cry anymore. And if I did, gave up, did the unthinkable, no one would know for months.
