Post:
  It's like I'm always sad because I don't know how to make myself feel better so I rely constantly on other people and since it pisses off my friends I turn to strangers on reddit, and if I'm not sad then I'm making low-effort shitposts Fuck my life xd‚Ñ¢ I'm going to read this in three years and wonder what the fuck was wrong with me at 16 But fine whatever I'll take my depression meds and get off of reddit now

The post suggests that the individual is constantly relying on other people for support and feeling sad when they are unable to make themselves feel better. This reliance on external sources for emotional well-being and the frustration it causes with friends implies a risk of feeling disconnected and lacking a sense of belonging, which is characteristic of thwarted belongingness.
