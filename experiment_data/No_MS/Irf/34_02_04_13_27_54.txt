Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My girlfriend has depression and I don't know how to deal with it. She becomes sad for no reason, and I didn't know at first, for some reason I thought it was just normal (you know, uhh, girls) so I even felt annoyed (now I feel really bad and guilty though. No need to bash me, internet). But then it gets worse. She says feels like a  piece of shit . That she's worthless and stuff. I didn't know she felt like that because apparently, she was afraid that I would think she was crazy. Any help please?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates that the girlfriend is experiencing feelings of worthlessness and believing herself to be a burden. These are symptoms of depression that can lead to a sense of thwarted belongingness, as the individual may feel disconnected from others and think that they are not valued or accepted. The mention of not wanting to be seen as 'crazy' also suggests a fear of rejection or judgment, further indicating a risk of thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Focus on the specific individual under discussion rather than making inferences about others in the situation. Review the information provided and ensure your response directly pertains to the poster's experience without inferring characteristics or mental health states not explicitly stated.

ITER 1
Yes
The post mentions that the girlfriend feels like a piece of shit and worthless, which are indicators of feelings of low self-worth and self-esteem. These feelings could be associated with a sense of thwarted belongingness.

Correct
Be careful not to attribute feelings and experiences reported about others to the individual writing the post. The feelings of worthlessness and being like 'a piece of shit' were expressed by the girlfriend, not the poster. The task requires analyzing the mental health of the individual writing the post, not others mentioned within it. In this case, the post does not provide sufficient information about the poster's own sense of belonging, so the evidence does not support a conclusion of 'Yes' to the risk of thwarted belongingness for the poster himself. Focus on the specific question asked and base your response solely on the information provided about the subject of the question.
