Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  no motivation, no drive I am l o s t I have looked into everything. Tried antidepressants. Looked into having ADHD. Got my thyroid and vitamin levels checked. Nothing is wrong... but I have no drive or motivation. I sleep like 10-12 hours a day. I can't bring myself to study or do work or care about anything. The occasional anxiety gives me energy, but the energy goes to contemplating suicide and wishing to opt put of life. I don't know what to do.
