Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Right now I'm feeling very alone I live in a city and don't know very many people because with depression and anxiety that I haven't treated for 7 years keeps me from wanting to meet new people because out in the real world it's scary. Always afraid that I will mess up what I say and that people will think I'm stupid. The people I do know half turned out to be horrible people that have now resorted to trying to tear me down daily. I love my daughter and my boyfriend but sometimes you want to talk to someone else. I don't know how else to explain it I just feel really trapped. End sad rant.
