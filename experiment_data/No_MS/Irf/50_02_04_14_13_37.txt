Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  (48M) I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for probably \~35 years now. I've been on pretty much all the different meds, had 2 rounds of TMS (30 sessions each), and have had therapy. Nothing has made me feel any better. I don't remember any other way to feel but sad, hopeless and suicidal. I don't know how much longer I can keep going on.
