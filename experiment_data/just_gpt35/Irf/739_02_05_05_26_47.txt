The post suggests feelings of isolation, a lack of support, and a longing for meaningful connections. The poster mentions that every time they think they have found someone to confide in, they stop responding or become unkind. They express tiredness of not having anyone in their life and describe their life as having no meaning. These feelings of social disconnection and a perceived lack of support align with the risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is commonly associated with depression.
