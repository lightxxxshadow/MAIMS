  Finding help Dealing with problems by yourself is hard. I can’t go to my family with my problems, they are in denial. My family is wealthy, I have a good job, I am getting my degree in math and kicking ass at it too. Nobody fucking believes me, thst 20 year olds like me can have problems I just need someone to talk to I guess. Ive been depressed and had bad anxiety before, but not to the point where it is now where I have attacks at work and even tear up sometimes. I feel like I’m going crazy. It’s all because of one girl. Amazing what one beautiful women can do to you. We talk everyday but I can’t help but feel like she thinks I’m a joke. The worst part is, I work with her...

Correct
While the student's response is accurate, ensure that future analyses avoid overgeneralizations and examine the context carefully. Continue to look for specific information that supports mental health assessments rather than inferring beyond what is presented.
