True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Help Hey I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I need help...I’m 20, about to have my college degree and have a pretty solid job but mentally I’m so fucked. I had a rough breakup about a month ago and ever since I’ve just been down &amp; depressed. Feel like shit about myself, like I can do no right. Like I have nothing to live for. And I’ve had struggles with depression before but this time seems much more intense and worse like it won’t ever go away. I’ve been thinking about suicide more and more and I don’t know what to do
