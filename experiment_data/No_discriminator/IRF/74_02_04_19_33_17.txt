Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I don‚Äôt know why I am so fucked up but I never feel like I can trust my parents word. My siblings are completely self successful and on their straight path to be coming everything the world wants them to be but me? I‚Äôm stuck in reverse. Sitting at home too anxious or exhausted to even shower or brush my teeth. My parents tell me they love me and they don‚Äôt care how long it takes me to succeed but I don‚Äôt believe them. I want to... but a part of me will always never believe them.

Yes
The post suggests a feeling of being left behind and not being able to succeed, leading to a lack of trust in the support and love from the parents. The poster also mentions feeling anxious and exhausted, and a part of them not believing the parents' words. Additionally, the answered questions from the mental scale indicate a strong sense of feeling like a burden and believing that others would be happier without them. This combination of feelings aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness, where the poster may perceive a lack of belonging and support from their parents and feel disconnected from others.
