  Its irony when my mom keeps bugging me like why wont I spend my time to talk with her instead of me sulking in my bedroom when everytime I talk to her,she always manage to either compare me with one of her friend's child who are far way more successful or reminds me of how much my dad not wanting me.I wish I was never alive.
