Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I was going to rant a bit, but it‚Äôs not like that would do any good. I‚Äôm just really lonely. I just have one request. Please comment anything. It can be ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù, it can be ‚Äú.‚Äù, it can be ‚Äúhi‚Äù. I just enjoy someone taking the time to write anything when I see that orange inbox, and it makes me really happy. I‚Äôll reply with a smiley face when I see it. I promise. Edit: thank you all! Thank you thankyouthankyou. :D
