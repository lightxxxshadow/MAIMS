Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  My girlfriend has depression and I don't know how to deal with it. She becomes sad for no reason, and I didn't know at first, for some reason I thought it was just normal (you know, uhh, girls) so I even felt annoyed (now I feel really bad and guilty though. No need to bash me, internet). But then it gets worse. She says feels like a  piece of shit . That she's worthless and stuff. I didn't know she felt like that because apparently, she was afraid that I would think she was crazy. Any help please?
