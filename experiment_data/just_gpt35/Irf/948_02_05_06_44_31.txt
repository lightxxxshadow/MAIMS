Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I feel really worthless because The only thing keeping me alive is a video game coming out in 15 days (DOOM eternal) and it won't even last for long. I've been told to tell CAHMS if anything is bothering me but anxiety tells me no. I'm considering jumping off the only skyscraper in my city when I finish the game because there will nothing else to make me happy. I'm just glad that there is something in the world that will make me happy, that is only for a short while though

The post indicates feelings of worthlessness, dependence on a video game for happiness, and considering self-harm when the game is finished. These feelings suggest a lack of meaningful connections and a risk of thwarted belongingness.
