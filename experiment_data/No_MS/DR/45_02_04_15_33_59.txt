Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Classmate/ bullying problems I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do. For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about  fake people , as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty. I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome. Thank you
