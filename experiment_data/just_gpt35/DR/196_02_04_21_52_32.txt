Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I wish I was bad at faking it Everyone thinks I'm better, that I just have trouble sleeping sometimes and college is tough the first semester blah blah. And I want to be perfect for my boyfriend and make him happy and act like this cute little girlfriend for him. But he always believes my fake smiles and my fake  I'm fine! , I wish he could tell because I don't want to tell him when I'm struggling. And at the sametime I want to tell him I think about killing myself often and I need him sometimes, but I don't want to force him to comfort me and be there for me.

The poster's statement about thinking about killing themselves often and feeling the need for someone to be there for them suggests symptoms of depression.
