Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have decided to do myself a favour and clean my room. These past years have not been very good to me. Towards the beginning of the month I moved into this room. My best friend hasn't talked to me since I moved out from where she lives. My shrink hasn't talked to me in 2~ weeks even though I've been trying to set up an appointment with her. I tripped acid on the 26th and basically was in a state of panic for 24~ hours and got taken advantage of by my sisters friends (my sister is a good person, but often doesn't see the bad in people). It's been rough but I at least owe myself this one thing. Sorry if this sounds like a pity party for myself but I just wanted to try and have someone that I need to report to. That seems to be the only way that I can get anything that I want to do done is if there is pressure on me. It's the only reason I applied for my last job. Sorry again for wasting your time. Hopefully you all have a good day! :) Also [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/3seUn) is an imgur album with before pictures Edit: It seems that /u/i-am-a-good-noodle has posted a very similar [thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7nhcsq/im_going_to_clean_my_room_today/). I hope that he accomplishes his goal and is able to find something to hold onto.

The post indicates feelings of isolation and a lack of social support, as the poster mentions that their best friend hasn't talked to them since they moved, and their therapist hasn't responded to their attempts to set up an appointment. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is the feeling of not belonging or being disconnected from others.
