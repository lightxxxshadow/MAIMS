The post demonstrates a sense of not belonging or feeling disconnected, as the poster expresses self-hatred, refusal to accept compliments, and feeling undeserving of life. These feelings indicate a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, where the individual's need for social connection is not being fulfilled.
