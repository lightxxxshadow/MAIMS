Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I recently had to go to the hospital per my therapist (or get IVCd). That was a month ago and nothing has gotten better. No meds have helped and I still find myself planning my death. My psychiatrist prescribes me ambien and I've googled the lethal dosage. I have more than enough. Part of me wants to live but the part that wants to die is bigger. Sadness is like an ocean. Sometimes you swim but right now I'm drowning and I'm not sure there is any coming back from it. Part of me wants to do it in my birthday but I fear that will just devastate my family even more. Sorry for the rant.
