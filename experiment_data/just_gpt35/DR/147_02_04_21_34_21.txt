  My Story - There is hope. **TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.** Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff  you're so young,   you'll grow out of it,   go see a therapist/take medication,  etc., I thought I'd share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone. **How Depression Affected Me**\- trigger warning It finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you don’t even know what’s you and what’s the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because it’s so familiar. We’re taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain isn’t real? In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I wouldn't want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I'd beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I didn't have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was 'enjoying' my college experience and 'exploring' my sexuality. I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I didn't understand why I was the only one that couldn't cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it didn't even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends. Even though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I couldn't admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I don't think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point. The first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I didn't want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I couldn't sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year. When
