Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm very depressed. I‚Äôm also an antinatalist. And I‚Äôm also a nihilist. So, I do not think there is a point to living. Furthermore, I wish I was never born. I do not want to die necessarily I just wish I was never alive in the first place. Everyday I wake up wanting to not live. What is keeping me from just killing myself. I‚Äôm beyond miserable.
