True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm young.So are my parents but I can't stop thinking that one day they'll be gone and so will my grandma whom I'm very close with. It brings me tears to me eyes every single day and night. I know death is a natural part of life but for some reason it tears me apart I have depression so that doesn't help. My doctor has me on meds but nothing seems to work I know for a fact ,obviously, that if I don't die before my parents or other family members do I'm going to be alive for the death of them. It's just a really scary thought I know I'm lucky to stil lhavd my parents as some people lost one or both of them. I just don't know what I'm going to do without them. Even as am adult I would be so distraught and lost in life without them. It's killing me It's something everyone goes through so I hate to feel so shitty about something that will happen regardless I try to make the most of every second im with them but when I'm with them I can't help but thinking the same thing- they'll be gone one day. It feels impossible to think anything positive and it sucks. I don't know how to stop thinking so negative but I pray and wish every day that these negative thoughts would stop flooding my mind so I can actually enjoy time spent with them because they could be gone anytime and I'd regret feeling so sad around them
