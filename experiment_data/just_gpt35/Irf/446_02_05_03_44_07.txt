Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Been suicidal for a few years and today im done. Ive been bullied since grade 1, my father used to bias me when i was young, i was lied too by damn near everyone, lost my mom in 2018, attempted on multiple ocasions, nobody ever fucking listens to me, and im finally past my tipping point. I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life. EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all. I also have medication im going to down before i start to...attempt fully. If I live, I may (cant guarantee) re edit this post. Don't feel bad for me, I've wanted this. I ACTIVELY want this. So, thank you for taking the time to read this (though I doubt itll ever be seen) and goodbye.

The post indicates a strong sense of isolation, loneliness, and lack of belonging. The poster mentions being bullied, feeling ignored, and experiencing biased treatment from their father. They also lost their mother and feel that nobody listens to them. These factors contribute to a higher risk of thwarted belongingness, which can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
