  You know, because people who have it sussed it go to parties and celebrate the new year whereas I re-watch a favourite movie or tv series at 11:30 so I can avoid midnight.

The post does not show risk of perceived burdensomeness. The individual's decision to avoid midnight celebrations and instead watch a movie or TV series may simply be a personal preference or a way to cope with social anxiety or discomfort in social situations. There is no indication of feeling burdensome to others.
