Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Getting all excited to do something and then canceling at the last moment, for no reason (or: How to Let Down Six Online Acquaintances With One Easy Trick) Last week I set up an online gaming event that was supposed to take place today. It didn't get a whole lot of interest relative to the other things on the forum, but I happened to have scheduled it very close to another event without realizing, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯, whatcha gonna do. Either way it was enough interest to follow through with it, so fast forward to today... ...When I had to write a very apologetic post four minutes before it was due to start, deflecting to some bullshit like  personal stress + shitty time management.  And just like that, I had disappointed everyone involved. Idk, it doesn't sound like much when it's written down, but it's been a while since I've done a last minute cancellation quite that bad, and I've just been left feeling really guilty about the whole thing.

The poster's behavior of getting excited and then canceling at the last moment for no reason does not necessarily indicate depression. It could be related to poor time management skills or difficulty in managing commitments and priorities.
