Correct
Continue to assess each item of the mental health scale thoroughly, considering the responses in conjunction with the reported post. Ensure to differentiate between the assessment of symptoms present and those absent. The absence of certain symptoms does not immediately negate a diagnosis if numerous other criteria are met. Keep grounding your conclusions in evidence, avoiding any unwarranted inferences or assumptions beyond the given information. Stay critical and reflective about the limitations of diagnosing solely based on a scale and a single statement without a full clinical interview.
