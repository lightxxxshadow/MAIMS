Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So yeah what the title says. I'm the one who ended the relationship though as it was toxic AF already. I shouldn't feel anything regarding the matter since I ended it. Yet I'm getting separation anxiety and loneliness on top of what I've been feeling prior. Help.

The poster mentions experiencing separation anxiety and loneliness even though they were the one who ended the toxic relationship. This suggests a possible risk of thwarted belongingness, as they may be struggling with feelings of disconnection and a desire for close relationships despite their decision to end the relationship.
