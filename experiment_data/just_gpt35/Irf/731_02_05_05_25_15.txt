Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I was first diagnosed as depression then later, bipolar. But I had this problem ever since I started to take the meds. I try SO hard to maintain the so called ‚Äúhappy‚Äù mood. I just try so hard to keep my depressions down below the surface so I don‚Äôt effect others around me. But whenever someone ruins my mood, I get uncontrollably mad and I begin to yell at them things I would never say to them. I get strong urge to throw stuff or hit that person but I know that‚Äôs wrong in the inside so I try to keep that under control. What I can‚Äôt control is yelling and cursing. I just get so mad at the fact that they have ruined my mood, which I have been trying so hard to maintain. Maybe I‚Äôm just tired of everything. Honestly I am sick of changing my meds to find the ‚Äúright‚Äù one and the side effects are killing me. I am seriously lacking memories and verbal skills and that stresses me out greatly. I am sick of depression and I hate myself for not being who I am before I was diagnosed. What‚Äôs wrong with me? Is this real me? I would never curse at someone or yell at them, but now look at me full of anger and madness. I just want to end my life seriously. I don‚Äôt want to hurt any more feelings of my loved ones and I hate myself for even thinking about hurting them when I was mad and uncontrollable. Does anyone else have this problem??
