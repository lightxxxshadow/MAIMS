Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  In this world full of wifi connection, human connection seems obsolete. I feel so alone. It's a cliche feeling, I know. Me against the world and nobody is on my side. The world is winning, etc. But I just feel so down. So so so depressed. I told myself that this 2018 I will embrace what is real - real people, real words, real friends. And then I realized everyone around me is fake. I envy those people who have friends who stick with them whatever happens. I wonder if I could still find real friends nowadays. Just one real friend would be nice. Just so I don't feel this way anymore. Some will say this too shall pass but it has been weeks and it ain't done yet.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates feelings of loneliness, being alone, and a desire for real connections with people. Additionally, the answers to the mental scale questions suggest that the poster feels like a burden on others and believes that people in their life wish they could be rid of them. These thoughts and emotions are indicative of a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Reassess the interpretation of the mental health scale answers, ensuring that each response is taken at face value without adding assumptions not supported by the text. Note that the poster does not explicitly say they feel like a burden on others; instead, answers to the questions regarding perceived burdensomeness (Questions ID 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) range from 'Not at all true for me' to 'Somewhat true for me' for only Question ID 5. The individual does express feelings of disconnection and lack of support, which should not be conflated with perceiving oneself as a burden. Focus on the evidence provided rather than inferring beyond the available information.

ITER 1
No
The poster's response to the questions regarding perceived burdensomeness (Questions ID 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) range from 'Not at all true for me' to 'Somewhat true for me' for only Question ID 5. The poster expresses feelings of disconnection and lack of support, but does not explicitly state feeling like a burden on others.

Incorrect
Review the significance of 'perceived burdensomeness' in detail and closely analyze the responses to Questions ID 2, 3, 4, 6, particularly noting the lack of agreement with these items. Focus on understanding the difference between a person's self-perceived burden and their social connections or feelings of loneliness. Avoid inferential errors by not extending the concept of burdensomeness without clear evidence in the responses provided by the poster.

ITER 2
No
The responses to Questions ID 2, 3, 4, and 6 indicate that the poster does not perceive themselves as a burden to others or believe that their death would be a relief. The focus of the post seems to be more on loneliness, feeling alone, and struggling to find real friends, rather than a sense of burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Review the answered questions and the post content in detail, focusing on the specific wording used. Note the expression of loneliness and desire for connection in the post. However, also consider the responses to the mental scale questions that suggest a lack of perceived social support and feelings of disconnection, which can be components of perceived burdensomeness. Reevaluate by considering both the emotional content of the post and the responses to the scale carefully, and try to differentiate between loneliness and perceived burdensomeness, which can sometimes overlap.

ITER 3
No
The post expresses feelings of loneliness and a desire for real connections, but the responses to the mental scale questions indicate a lack of perceived social support and disconnection. While the poster may feel alone and struggle to find genuine friends, there is no direct indication of perceiving themselves as a burden or that others would be relieved or wish to be rid of them.

Incorrect
Revisit the mental scale responses; specifically, items related to feelings of being a burden. Though the poster denies being a burden or causing greater harm, the expression of feeling unsupported and disconnected can be indicative of perceived burdensomeness. Assess the discrepancy in item 5 and the sentiment of being alone without genuine connections from the post, as these may hint at perceived burdensomeness.

ITER 4
Yes
The post expresses feelings of loneliness and disconnection, indicating a lack of support and genuine connections. Although the poster denies being a burden or causing harm, this discrepancy along with the somewhat true response to item 5 suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Review the answered questions carefully, avoiding the tendency to overgeneralize or infer negative characteristics that are not explicitly stated. Analyze each item critically, focusing on what is actually conveyed by the respondent's answers rather than your own assumptions or biases. Maintain objectivity by distinguishing between the poster's statements about loneliness and seeking connection, versus the notion of burdensomeness, which the poster largely denies. Refine your ability to discern the subtle differences between social disconnectedness and perceived burdensomeness.

ITER 5
No
The post primarily focuses on feelings of loneliness and the desire for genuine human connection. The poster mentions feeling down and depressed but does not express a strong belief or perception of being a burden to others. While the poster does mention envying those with real friends and feeling disconnected from others, there is no indication of a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Review the answered questions from the mental health scale closely, especially where the poster expressed sentiments related to being a burden ('Somewhat true for me' in response to Question ID of 5). Consider the consistency between the poster's expressed feelings of disconnection and not being cared for (answers to Questions ID of 7, 9, 13, and 14) and the concept of perceived burdensomeness. The poster may not explicitly state they are a burden, but the feelings of not being cared for and disconnection can contribute to a sense of burdensomeness. Analyze the answered questions in conjunction with the post to avoid missing subtle indications of the poster's mental state.

ITER 6
Yes
The poster's response to Question ID of 5, where they indicated that it is somewhat true that the people in their life wish they could be rid of them, suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness. Additionally, the poster's expressed feelings of disconnection and not feeling cared for in their responses to Questions ID of 7, 9, 13, and 14 further support this risk.

Correct
Continue to carefully analyze the connections between the social media post content and the responses to the relevant mental health scale questions without making assumptions beyond the provided data. Ensure to avoid overgeneralizing or inferring negative characteristics that are not supported by the evidence. Be cautious not to attribute the emotions or mental health statuses of others mentioned in the posts to the poster themselves. Maintain objectivity and validate each conclusion with the presented responses.
