Post:
  My parents got a divorce like in June My whole life turned upside down. I got depression, my grades were failing, and have been very suicidal recently. I just found out that my dad has been cheating on my mom for about a year before their divorce. It really messed me up. I just want someone to talk to. Please PM. I want to talk. Not about this just a normal conversation. Please! Someone

The post indicates that the poster is feeling suicidal and is requesting someone to talk to. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual feels like a burden to others and may believe that their problems are overwhelming and too much for others to handle.
