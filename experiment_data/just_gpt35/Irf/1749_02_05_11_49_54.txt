Post:
  Today has been the worst fucking day I've had in a long time without getting into details due to legal reasons. I already feel like I've just been  here  and drifting along almost like a zombie for the past 6 years and don't know if I can keep going on. I know the pain I'll leave behind but I don't know if my soul/heart can take this anymore
