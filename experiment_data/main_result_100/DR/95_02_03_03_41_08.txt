Post:
  Accidentally kissing my friend after a party, what did i fuck up So there's this situation that happened once a week or two ago that kind of made my pretty-close-but-not-best friend dude friend feel...distant? I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward  accidentally  distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this. I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? Im well known for liking girls and have short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
Based on the answers provided, the poster's responses suggest feelings of guilt, difficulty making decisions, and decreased ability to concentrate. These are symptoms commonly associated with depression.

Incorrect
Review the diagnostic criteria for depression carefully and avoid conflating temporary emotional states with clinical conditions. Guilt feelings and decision-making difficulties alone do not constitute a diagnosis of depression. Consider the full context of the poster's situation and avoid overgeneralization based on limited information. Look for persistent patterns rather than isolated incidents when assessing mental health, and be mindful not to diagnose without sufficient evidence.

ITER 1
Yes
The poster mentioned feeling guilty a good part of the time, having greater difficulty in making decisions, and having trouble concentrating. These symptoms, along with the context provided, suggest a possibility of depression. However, further evaluation would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

Incorrect
Avoid overgeneralizing or diagnosing based on limited information. While the poster exhibits some symptoms that may be associated with depression, such as guilt and issues with concentration and decision-making, these alone are not sufficient to diagnose depression. Additionally, the context of these symptoms is not clear. The poster's behaviors and experiences described in the post do not necessarily indicate depression and could be related to other factors or stressors in their life. When answering mental health questions, students should refrain from making a diagnosis and instead observe if there is a pattern that warrants professional evaluation. Remember to consider the whole context and avoid confirmation bias. Provide a response that reflects the complexity of mental health and the necessity for thorough assessment by a professional.

Additionally, the context of these symptoms is not clear.

The complexity of mental health requires thorough assessment by a professional.

Incorrect
Avoid making assumptions about the individual's mental health without evidence from the post and the answered questions. Focus on the evidence presented rather than inferencing additional unstated information. Review the relevant symptoms of depression in-depth and differentiate between emotional responses to complex social situations and clinical symptoms. When analyzing answered questions from a mental health scale, do not ignore responses that indicate significant issues like 'feeling guilty' and 'difficulty making decisions'. Do not diagnose, but do recognize when the pattern of answers suggests that a professional evaluation is warranted. Instead of dismissing possible symptoms, consider how they may or may not fit into a broader behavioral context and pattern that could suggest depression. Consistently apply the same rigor to all items of the mental health scale when analyzing its results.

ITER 3
Yes
The poster's responses to the mental health scale indicate feelings of guilt, difficulty making decisions, and difficulty concentrating. These responses, along with the description of feeling lost, wanting to have sex as a way to alleviate the 'hots,' and potential loss of a friendship, suggest that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression.

Incorrect
Avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information. Focus on concrete evidence from provided answers and differentiate between actions taken and mental health symptoms. Challenge assumptions and clarify the difference between impulsivity, interpersonal conflicts, and actual indicators of depression.

ITER 4
No
The poster does not demonstrate significant indicators of depression based on the provided information. While there may be some interpersonal conflicts and feelings of guilt, there is no evidence of other symptoms such as loss of pleasure, worthlessness, changes in appetite, or changes in sleeping pattern.

Correct
Continue to analyze the poster's mental health using their direct responses to the mental health scale without inferring additional issues that are not explicitly stated. Be cautious to avoid assuming that conflicts or experiences of guilt alone are indicative of depression. Keep applying critical thinking to distinguish between emotional reactions to situational stressors and clinical symptoms of a mental health condition.
