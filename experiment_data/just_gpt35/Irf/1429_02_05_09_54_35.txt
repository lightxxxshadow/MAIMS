Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Honestly it‚Äôs just constant exhaustion and pain and stress, it‚Äôs too much for me to handle. I can‚Äôt handle this drag we call life, going to school every morning, going home and studying, dealing with my father, it‚Äôs all just too much. I can‚Äôt do it on my own but I can‚Äôt ask others to save me either, well there isn‚Äôt really one that exists sadly. I guess I‚Äôll just be alone for some more years : (.

The poster expresses feelings of being overwhelmed by exhaustion, pain, and stress, and mentions being unable to handle their life. They also mention the inability to ask for help or the lack of someone who can save them. These statements indicate a possible risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual believes they are a burden to others and cannot rely on them for support.
