True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôve bought this all on myself. I have a porn and sex addiction that has lead me to chest on my girlfriend. We have decided to try and make it work but I can‚Äôt stop the thoughts of regret and hatred to myself. I feel like the only thing that would help me and my girlfriend move on would be me out if the situation. I don‚Äôt think I could physically go through with it but the thoughts are always there. Not really looking for advice but happy to hear anything anyone has to say it‚Äôs just been a help writing this down
