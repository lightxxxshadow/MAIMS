Post:
  I‚Äôm so tired. I don‚Äôt have any friends. I haven‚Äôt been going to work. I dropped all of my classes. My therapy doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm in love with someone I can‚Äôt have and it‚Äôs eating me up. I literally just stay at home all day now because I never feel good anywhere. My family doesn‚Äôt care about me. I‚Äôm a failure. I think I‚Äôm ready to give up
