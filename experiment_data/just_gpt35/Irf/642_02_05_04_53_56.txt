Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Lately, most often at night, I'll get extremely anxious and begin feeling like I'm not me. Like I was someone else who was placed into this body. I also get the physical feeling that the world stops existing, and that I am isolated to my area. I feel like I'm going insane. This has started recently (last 2-3 months), I'm 17, and have not begun taking, or have stopped taking any medications. Is this an anxiety attack? I'm either numb, or this, and I'm scared this is forever.

The poster's feelings of anxiety, dissociation, and fear of going insane indicate a potential risk of thwarted belongingness. They express a sense of being someone else in their own body, feeling disconnected from the world, and being isolated to their area. These experiences can contribute to feelings of social disconnection and a lack of belonging, which are key components of thwarted belongingness.
