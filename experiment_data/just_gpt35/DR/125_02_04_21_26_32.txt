Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I wasn't supposed to live this long I tried to kill myself on my birthday, january 7th, but failed because i vomited up all of the drain cleaner I drank. They kept me in a psych ward for a week. I just came back home and it is kinda surreal given that i packed all my shit up and wrapped up most loose ends the only feeling I can compare this to is like beating an open-world game and just wandering around with nothing left to do. Honestly I am prepared to die but am not willing to overcome my instinctual fear of death again.
