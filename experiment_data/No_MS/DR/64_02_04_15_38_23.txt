Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Feeling nostalgic? Does anyone else obsess over a point of time in their life when they felt like they were truly happy? For me the last time in my life when I felt like I was truly happy was 2013 and 2014 (mostly the summers) Ever since then life has changed so much. My depression got worse than ever. I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what? I keep telling myself this is just a stage and things will get good again but it just seems to get worse. Nostalgia can be a great feeling but itâ€™s killing me now knowing how good life once was.
