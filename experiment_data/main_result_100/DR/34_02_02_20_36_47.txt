Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Tomorrow is my 35th birthday. So tomorrow is my 35th birthday. I really thought I would have a family, have a husband or wife and just be happy having this awesome life. Nope. At 35, I am miserably in debt, unhappy, no family and I'm very far from all of my friends. So, yay I guess.
