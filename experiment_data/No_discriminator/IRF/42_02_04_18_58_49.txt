Yes
The post suggests a lack of social connections and feelings of being a burden on society. The poster mentions having zero friends outside of work and feeling like their music isn't helping. The responses to the mental scale questions also indicate a sense of isolation, disconnection from others, and feeling like they make things worse for the people in their life. These factors align with the concept of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for certain mental health problems.
