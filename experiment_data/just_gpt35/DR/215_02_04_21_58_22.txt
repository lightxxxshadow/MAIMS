Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Alone It’s been so long since someone’s actually made me feel okay. It’s been so long since someone has genuinely made me laugh. I get more high strung, anxious and depressed every day and everyone around me reminds me all the time. Living is becoming a chore.

The poster expresses feelings of sadness, loneliness, and loss of enjoyment in activities (e.g. mentioning that it's been a long time since someone made them feel okay or genuinely laugh). They also mention feeling high strung, anxious, and depressed every day, and that living is becoming a chore. These symptoms align with those commonly associated with depression.
