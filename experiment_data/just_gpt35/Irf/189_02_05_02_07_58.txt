Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  For a long time I feel like I am just going through the motions. Feel empty, last funeral (late 2016) I went to a very close family friend who treated me like a grandson but I felt nothing. I just felt nothing, like I was waiting for it to end. For last 3-4 years it has been hard for me to feel anything. I haven't been feeling suicidal at all but I wish I could feel. I haven't been happy for awhile, just want to lie in bed all day. I don't even know what to do anymore. I feel like a hamster in a wheel, just moving in place. I have always been the odd one in the family, I try to put on a smile. I smile on the outside but inside is nothing. The family disappointment, the one who everyone sees as the family loser. Its like I try to feel something. I try to make myself angry so I can feel something, anything so I feel alive.
