Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It was like a big fucking slap to the face. A reminder of how fucking depressed and hopeless I am compared to the rest of my family members. Had to go outside and walk for a bit because I didn't want anyone to see me break down. Idk if I'll still be here for 2019 New Year's Eve, but if I am, I really hope things will be different. If you guys also had a shitty New Year's Eve, I'm really sorry because I know how much it fucking sucks. Hope things get better for you this year. *sending virtual panda hugs*

The post expresses feelings of being depressed and hopeless compared to the rest of the family. The poster even mentions having thoughts about not being around for the next New Year's Eve, indicating potential suicidal ideation. This suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness, feeling like a burden to others and the belief that their absence may be beneficial.
