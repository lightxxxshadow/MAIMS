Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Possibly most of my depression stems from dwelling on things that happened in the past. Things that could have been and should have not. Coming up on my twenty-second birthday, I still dwell on my teen years where things seemed like hell, but as I look back they were the best years of my life.

The post does not indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness. The poster is reflecting on their past and experiencing nostalgia for their teenage years, rather than expressing feelings of social isolation or exclusion.
