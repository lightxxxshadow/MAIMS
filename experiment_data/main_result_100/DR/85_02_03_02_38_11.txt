Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  is there a comfort in sadness? my therapist, my psychiatrist, and my parents all say i’m “so much better” than i used to be. and i am. i know that. i don’t even think about suicide anymore and i haven’t self harmed in a few years. but my brain is still fucked up and it always will be. i can live with that. but not when all these people around me are telling me how happy i am. just because i’m better than i was a few years ago doesn’t mean i’m good. i’m better by comparison. but that’s it. and i hate being told how “great” i’m doing. but then i think maybe i’m just overreacting to the word “happy” because i’m more comfortable being sad. i’ve been sad for so long that there’s a certain comfort in it. sad is familiar. happy is unknown and risky. can anyone relate to this or am i alone?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's responses to the questions of the mental scale indicate symptoms of depression. They express sadness, pessimism, feeling of past failure, loss of pleasure, self-dislike, and less energy than before, which are all characteristic of depression.

Correct
Good analysis of the individual's responses to the mental health scale indicates an understanding of symptoms of depression. Continue to carefully differentiate between the individual's own statements and your own inferences, avoiding assumptions not supported by the evidence provided.
