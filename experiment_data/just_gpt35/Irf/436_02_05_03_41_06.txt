Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June. I didn't get another job until September. So here i am, only working there a few months, and this is the second time i've done a no call no show within 3 weeks. I can't get myself to get out of bed. I just turned 19. I had to have my mom call off for me the other day because i was having a mental breakdown. The jobs i have are not even stressful, but i'm so terrified to actually CALL and talk to a manager and tell them i can't come in, and it's not like being depressed is a work excuse. I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression? Or have any recommendations on jobs? I take medication, so there's nothing else to really help. I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks..

The post mentions feeling useless if not working, struggles with communication to call off work, and having frequent lows. These aspects indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness, a feeling of not fitting in or lacking social connections.
