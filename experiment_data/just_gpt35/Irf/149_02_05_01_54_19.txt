Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I started my job a couple months ago. I have worn a sweater over my work shirt or long sleeves with it to cover my scars. I know that I shouldn't be ashamed of them, but I often feel that way. However, today I decided to say fuck it and just wear short sleeves. I was uncomfortable and didn't want anyone to notice, but I'm still glad I did it.

The poster's statement about feeling uncomfortable and not wanting anyone to notice their scars suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness. They may feel like their scars are burdensome or cause them to be perceived as burdensome by others.
