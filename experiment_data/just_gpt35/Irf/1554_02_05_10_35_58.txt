  I will try to fix everything. Your words save me a life. You are best community ever. I will ask help to my Wife‚Äôs husband. He is pretty good and rich man. Reddit I love u &lt;3. I was too scared to ask help but u help me to realize life doesn‚Äôt end, when u lost money‚Äôs.And i wanna give advice for everyone who lost any hope for some reason(lost girlfriend,money, who scared to tell relatives about orientation or tired to live or something else) when I‚Äôm step on edge of roof. I Understand life doesn‚Äôt end when u lose something important to u, life end when u decide to give up. So pls never give up. U must live whatever it takes. Any complexity is just a step that you must overcom, if you can get it alone just ask for help and in the whole world will be one person who can help u to resolve it. Good luck buddies
