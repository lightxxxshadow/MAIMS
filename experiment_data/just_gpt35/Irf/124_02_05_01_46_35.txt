Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Just curious, as last year I have lost most if not all of my friends and in the New Year even my sibling has told me  I don't want to be around negative people  and proceeded to cut me out in all social platforms and in real life. I just can't help but think that I don't choose to be this way, it's just how I am...

The poster mentions losing most, if not all, of their friends and being cut out by their sibling. This suggests a lack of social connection and a feeling of being excluded, which aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
