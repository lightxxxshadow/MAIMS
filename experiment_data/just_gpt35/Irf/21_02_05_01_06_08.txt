True Label:	Yes
Post:
  i hate how i isolate myself and then complain i hate myself since i know what i have to do but i cant choose it because i seem to love being sad / depressed i hate myself since i cant self harm like i desire i hate myself since i cant go back and change what has happened i hate myself since i put myself in these situations i hate myself since i just hate myself why cant i just die.. nobody would care if it happened this cruel world is sickening and i just wish i could put everyone that's made all of us suicidal on suicide watch. i hate the human race so much like i dont even know how i feel anymore all i know is sadness at the moment and pretending to be happy on the internet. like ive tried co2 poisoning for a short period of time with a towel covering my nose and mouth but i got scared and i didnt want anyone walking in on me attempting since i dont have my own room. i just wish i was able to do what many of you brave souls have realized on this reddit nobody understands at all and im just confused at the moment i dont even know why i wrote this but i hope you have a good new year. if you wasted your time reading this im sooo sorry please please pleaseee just try to get the time you spent on this back.

The post suggests a strong feeling of worthlessness, self-hatred, and a desire for self-harm or death. The individual expresses an intense aversion towards themselves, isolates from others and believes that nobody would care if they died. This indicates a possible risk of perceived burdensomeness, as they believe they are a burden to others and that the world would be better off without them.
