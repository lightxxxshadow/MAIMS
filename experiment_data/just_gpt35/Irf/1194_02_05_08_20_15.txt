Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Tried a couple of them, and I'll be honest with you: I absolutely dreaded them both. I don't want to get deep into it, but one of my therapists took time during our session just to talk with someone personal on their cellphone. (Hard to believe, I know.) I've heard from a few people who have taken therapy say that you have to find the right therapist for you. But hearing that argument convinces me that I'm essentially paying people to listen to me until I find someone that says the right thing to comfort/ save  me. Maybe it's just my brain telling me that, but it just rationalizes my personal stigma towards seeking professional help for myself.

The mention of feeling neglected and the skepticism towards therapy suggest a possible risk of thwarted belongingness.
