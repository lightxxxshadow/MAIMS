Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I’m quite literally dead inside Even when I feel emotions, it’s just despair and sadness. The rest of it just pure numbness. I can’t remember half the thing I was doing today and I don’t even care. The only thing keeping me alive is video games and the hope of some new bond in the next school year. Eventually, it won’t be enough. I’ve always felt broken inside. Ever since 6th grade. But there. Just needed some of that off my chest. Sorry for bitching and wasting your time.
