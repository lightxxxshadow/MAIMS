True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I turn 26 this month. I can‚Äôt figure out what brought me to this point but I have been wishing to not exist for the past few years now. I see no point in living on to experience more pain. But I am terrified of a painful suicide and also my little sister has been having similar issues, I can‚Äôt be the reason she is pushed over the edge. I feel so helpless and lonely and unloved. I want it to end...
