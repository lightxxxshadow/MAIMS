True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My best friend has completely cut me out of his life for a girl and i am feeling depressed Hey guys, ive known my best mate for 7 years and we finished high school and now both go to the same uni, we were so tight, like brothers. We were gym partners, helped other out with assignments, and hanged out so frequently. That was all until he got a girlfriend. He met with this chick like 5 months ago and i was pleased for the dude, he seemed happy. 5 months on he still seems so attached to his girl, he rarey texts me and we used to play xbox together but none of those happen anymore. On the rare occasion when we do go to hang out he is always on his phone texting his girl, infact even in the cinema we watched a movie he was literally texting her during the film... even on xbox i hear the phone go off every minute or so We done so much shit together.... i gave him a driving instructor with a family discount cos i knew the guy and he got his license now, i helped him raise $600 for a new pc, and even went into a lil business together where i invested and he knew the contacts. This dude was my brother basiclly and now he never has time for me, we were so damn close and i wish things could go back to how they were without this girl because she is so paranoid of him talking to another girl I dont get why he has done this to me, ive always been there for him and now he doesnt even respond to my messages, i see him active on facebook but doesnt even read messages... i helped this dude out so much in high school he was going to fail, i taught him some shit and thats how we got close and he passed literally because of me. I dont know what to do... i feel like we are becoming so dinstant and only communicate once a week or so, im feeling so depressed and mentally hurt.... TL;DR; : What shall i do? Shall i talk to him or just wait it out
