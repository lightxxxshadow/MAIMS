  Winter semester begins tomorrow and I'm in denial. Back to group work, trying to make acquaintances, perform my best. I really just don't care, and thinking of going physically pains me.

The poster expresses a sense of not caring and feeling physical pain at the thought of attending classes and engaging in group work. This suggests a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as they may believe their presence and contributions are burdensome to others.
