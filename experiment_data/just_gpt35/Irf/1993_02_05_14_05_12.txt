Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Just been in a really bad place mentally I‚Äôm grateful for all the little things I have in my life. But the odds are stacked against me and I can‚Äôt even think straight or even focus in uni or even drive properly. Everyone else has a better life than me I know I should stop complaining and just try to make things better for myself but that‚Äôs so much easier being said than done. I‚Äôve tried everything but nothing has worked for me . I see the guy that my girlfriend cheated on me with he laughs right at my face just a spit on my face to show what a failure I am. Sorry for all the self loathing but I just have no one to talk to. Might just drive my car off the bridge tonight
