Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I didn‚Äôt sleep very well last night and I returned to work after several days off and it has thoroughly and completely exhausted me. I did want to share something that I read last night that I have thought about ever since I read it. I started his book The Noonday Demon last night in order to properly understand my own struggles with depression. His article Anatomy of Melancholy (http://andrewsolomon.com/articles/anatomy-of-melancholy/) he wrote in 1999 for The New Yorker in which he talks about his own personal battles with depression have made him a huge advocate for depression and is very informative. Andrew also has done a couple of TED talks. My personal favorite of his can be found here (https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share).
