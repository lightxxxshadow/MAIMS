Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I am losing myself HELP ME OUT To start of, i am such a loser that i flip out on people which include my own friends, siblings and parents, most of the time i am depressed because i dont have anyone else to hangout with.All i seek from this platform is all the help i need to be better. Little bit of background of me, I live with my parents and i hardly have any friends except 2 close ones. I feel i'm losing my only close friends because of my extreme behaviour such as getting into unnecessary fights, causing some sort of misunderstanding and blaming them for absolutely anything.Sometimes i am too caring and sometimes i am too rude. I am struggling with addiction to porn because i have no other option to make me feel happy. I have an on and off relationship with my parents and siblings because of my unpredictable behaviour. I have lost interest in life. I have lost myself. Maybe soon lose whatever i have got left. But i believe i could get better if i could get some help, maybe some of you could help me out with how to deal with the struggles i am facing. Thanks.
