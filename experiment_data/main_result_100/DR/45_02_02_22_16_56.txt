Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Classmate/ bullying problems I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do. For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about  fake people , as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty. I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome. Thank you

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's description of the classmate's behavior, such as feeling superior, harassing others, being rude and insulting, shouting instead of discussing problems, and seeking attention through loud and nonsense comments, indicates a potential pattern of aggressive and attention-seeking behavior. These traits, along with the annoyance and frustration expressed by the poster, suggest that the poster may be experiencing feelings of sadness, helplessness, and possibly depression due to the ongoing bullying problem in their class.

Incorrect
Carefully distinguish between the subject of the post and the subject of the mental health scale. The post discusses the behavior of a classmate, not the poster. The poster is providing an observation, not expressing personal mental health issues. Utilize the scale responses to make inferences about the individual answering the scale, not the individuals they describe. Avoid making assumptions about the poster's mental health when they have not indicated any personal distress consistent with the scale's measure, such as symptoms related to depression. Stay objective and avoid overinterpretation of the information provided.

ITER 1
No
The post does not indicate any personal distress or symptoms related to depression. The poster is describing the behavior of a classmate, not expressing personal mental health issues.

Correct
Keep focusing on the information provided and avoid making assumptions beyond the evidence. Maintain clear boundaries between the subjects being discussed and the individual reporting the situation.
