Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hello all, I have been feeling down for weeks now and I just check Google just now all the depression symptoms. And I match almost all of them but one. I am still enjoy what I like. Like game (dota 2) and I really love watching movies and TV series. I still have those enjoyment I felt before now. How can I know if I am really depressed or not? I can't go to get a professional help cause I'm broke as fuck right now. Your help would be pretty cool. Thanks

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness as the poster mentions that they still have enjoyment in activities they used to like (playing games, watching movies, and TV series).
