('8', ['indirectly_mention', "Somewhat true for me###The post implies that the poster might not feel a strong sense of belonging in the present moment, given the need for reassurance.

('11', ['indirectly_mention', "Not at all true for me###Based on the post, the person states that they 'just need reassurance right now', which implies that they are seeking connection and reassurance from others.

The responses to the questions indicate a high level of perceived burdensomeness. The poster feels that the people in their life would be happier without them, that they make things worse for others, and that they often feel like an outsider in social gatherings. These feelings suggest a belief that they are a burden on others and could potentially be at risk for perceived burdensomeness.
