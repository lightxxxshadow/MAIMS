Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm 20 years old. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety with 2 years, on SSRIs. I'm in a college course that doesn't excite me. I'm unmotivated and I feel so hollow. I'm failing my classes and I feel so worthless. All I want to do is sleep. I've lost interest in all my hobbies. It's 1.55 a.m and I feel so lost. (Just needed somewhere to write down what's going through my head and found this sub)
