Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I was wondering if anyone else gets really fucking sick of people complaining about specific years and shit due to one awful thing that happened to them that year. No year will ever be perfect, each will bring bad things, so why is it that the entire population complains about specific years like they were the worst fucking thing that ever happened to them? It's hard for me to put what my thoughts are into text on this issue but basically what I'm saying is that years are just a measure of time and it's really dumb to waste your memory trying to remember which are good and which are bad. I get really pissed around new years because all I fucking hear is people talking about how a year was amazing or shit due to fucking 3 or less events that happened during it. Sorry for swearing a lot I know it makes me sound idiotic.

The poster's frustration and anger towards people complaining about specific years and events, as well as the mention of feeling isolated and misunderstood, indicates a possible risk of thwarted belongingness.
