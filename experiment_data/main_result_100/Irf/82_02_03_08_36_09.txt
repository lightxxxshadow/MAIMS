Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell. She and my father are separated. He's struggling with his own battle. I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away. I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). She's lost her white collar job about a year ago. She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go. Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape). I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse. I can't quit college to move back and take care of her. Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her. Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier. She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement. She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this. She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job. She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite). I don't know what to do. I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates risk of thwarted belongingness because the poster's mother is becoming more reclusive, not taking care of herself, and not trying to fix her situation. The poster is worried about her mother's depression getting worse, the deterioration of her mother's house and finances, and her lack of improvement despite therapy and medication. These factors suggest a sense of disconnection and isolation, which align with a risk of thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Please be careful to distinguish between the subject's perspective and the perspectives of those around the subject. The answered questions of the mental scale explicitly refer to the poster's own feelings about belonging and impact on others' lives, and all suggest that the poster does not feel like a burden nor disconnected from others. The concerns expressed in the post are about the poster's mother's mental health and not the poster's own feelings of belonging or burdensomeness. When assessing risk of thwarted belongingness or any other mental health concern, focus on the actual responses given by the subject in a scale instead of assuming or inferring feelings not explicitly stated. While the poster's description of their mother might indicate the mother's risk of thwarted belongingness, the answered questions indicate that the poster does not feel disconnected or as though they make things worse for others, which does not suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness for themselves.

ITER 1
No
Based on the answered questions of the mental scale, the poster does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. The poster's own feelings about belonging and impact on others' lives, as indicated by their responses, suggest that they do not feel like a burden nor disconnected from others. The concerns expressed in the post are mainly about the poster's mother's mental health, not the poster's own feelings of belonging or burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Review the content of the posts and the answered questions carefully to distinguish between the poster’s own feelings and the situation concerning the surrounding individuals. Focus on distinguishing the subject of each question and consider who the answers are actually about. Avoid overgeneralizing based on information not provided in the post or the answers from the mental health scale. Ensure that your conclusion about thwarted belongingness specifically reflects the poster's personal sense of belonging and not that of others mentioned in the scenario.

ITER 2
Yes
The post shows that the poster feels somewhat disconnected from other people and is not close to other people. This indicates a sense of thwarted belongingness, as the poster is experiencing a lack of close connections and feeling disconnected from others.

Incorrect
Ensure to differentiate between the poster's own feelings and those expressed about another person. The responses provided from the mental health scale are the poster's, indicating they do not feel a sense of thwarted belongingness themselves; they are concerned about their mother's mental health. Reassess the given information regarding the poster personally and avoid attributing the mental state of others described in the post to the poster.

ITER 3
No
The poster's own responses to the mental health scale indicate that they do not feel a sense of thwarted belongingness themselves. The concerns expressed in the post are about the poster's mother's mental health, not their own.

Correct
Continue to carefully distinguish between the poster's own feelings and the situation being described about others. Ensure each analysis strictly adheres to the provided information and does not include assumptions that cannot be substantiated by the evidence presented.
