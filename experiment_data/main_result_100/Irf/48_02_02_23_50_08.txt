Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore. Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a year now and in therapy for 2 years. Just putting that out there.

####################################
Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates feelings of disconnection from other people, feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and a lack of satisfying interactions on a daily basis. These are all indicative of thwarted belongingness, which is the feeling of being excluded or isolated from meaningful social connections.

Incorrect
Carefully review the self-reported answers to the mental health scale questions, which suggest that the poster does not perceive themselves as a burden, believes others do not wish for their absence, and reports feeling cared for by others. Although they feel disconnected, this is not sufficient to conclude thwarted belongingness without disregarding their other positive social perceptions. Focus on the balance of self-reported data rather than selectively emphasizing aspects that support a predetermined conclusion.

ITER 1
No
The poster's self-reported data suggests that they do not perceive themselves as a burden and believe that others care about them. While they do feel disconnected, this is not sufficient to conclude thwarted belongingness without considering their positive social perceptions.

Incorrect
Consider all aspects of social connectedness discussed in the post. The poster feels disconnected despite some positive social perceptions. Re-evaluate their answers and the criteria for thwarted belongingness to ensure a comprehensive assessment.

ITER 2
Yes
The poster mentioned feeling disconnected from other people and feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, indicating a lack of social belongingness. Additionally, while they have some positive social interactions, they still feel that they don't have people they can turn to in times of need. These indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Ensure you are accurately analyzing the responses provided. The poster indicated they do not feel like a burden, they feel cared for, and have at least one satisfying interaction every day, which does not support a conclusion of thwarted belongingness. Cross-reference claims in the post with the responses to the scale and avoid over inferring negative characteristics.

ITER 3
No
The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. The poster indicated that they do not feel like a burden, they feel cared for, and have at least one satisfying interaction every day, which does not support a conclusion of thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Review the concepts of thwarted belongingness again and carefully analyze the specific answers given on the scale. Consider the answer 'Very true for me' to Question ID of 11 about feeling disconnected, which might indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness, and reconcile this with the other responses to get a comprehensive understanding of the poster's social connections.

ITER 4
Yes
The answer 'Very true for me' to Question ID 11 about feeling disconnected indicates a risk of thwarted belongingness.

Correct
Review the provided answers considering the full context before making a conclusion. Avoid relying on a single statement (feeling disconnected) to diagnose thwarted belongingness. Weigh all responses equally and avoid confirmation bias towards negative aspects.
