Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm always there for people who want to talk to me when they're sad, as I've done this many times in the past, but there is no a single who I can turn to when I'm sad. Goddamn, I literally the person who hurgs others when they cry; yet, they can't even reply a simple message. I guess that's it.

The post indicates a sense of social isolation and a lack of social support. The poster expresses their willingness to support others but feels like they have no one to turn to when they themselves are sad. This can be indicative of thwarted belongingness, which is the feeling of not belonging or being disconnected from others.
