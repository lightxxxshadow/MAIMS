The poster's response to the answered questions of the mental scale indicates a risk of thwarted belongingness. They feel like a burden on society, believe their death would be a relief to others, and think that people in their life wish they could be rid of them. They also feel disconnected from others, often feel like an outsider in social gatherings, and have few satisfying interactions. These sentiments suggest a lack of social connection and a sense of not belonging, which aligns with the concept of thwarted belongingness.
