Post:
  Its extremely difficult for me to ask for help. But I tried. And I got straight up ignored. Note taken, definitely best course of action just to suck it up and push it down. Even though it's just getting worse and worse.

The post suggests that the individual is experiencing difficulty in asking for help and feels ignored when they do seek assistance. This pattern of behavior may indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the person feels like a burden to others and believes that they shouldn't bother asking for help.
