Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Life for me is gonna fall apart and it'll be the end of me (this is my first post and I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is off) So recently my parents have been on me (M 17) about getting a job, getting college information, SAT information, getting my licence and spending more time with the family. Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wasn't going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom. My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She's there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I've been slipping a little in my grades (All B's and C's) and my parents have a very strict rule that if I don't keep good grades I'll have to leave my girlfriend. My problem is that if I leave her I'll have nothing to help me get through hard times. I'm only living for her and I'll have no point to be around otherwise. Sorry for venting but I've been wanting to post here for months but never felt as if my problems have been worth it.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's feelings of hopelessness, their belief that their life is falling apart, and their reliance on their girlfriend as their only support system indicate symptoms of depression.

Incorrect
Avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information. The post indicates stress and emotional distress, but does not provide enough evidence to diagnose depression. Consider the context and avoid diagnosing mental health disorders without comprehensive information. Encourage seeking professional assessment for an accurate evaluation.

ITER 1
No
Although the poster expresses stress and emotional distress, there is not enough evidence in the post to definitively diagnose depression. It is important to consider the context and avoid making a diagnosis without comprehensive information. Encouraging seeking professional assessment for a more accurate evaluation is advised.

Correct
Continue to avoid over-inference by not diagnosing without clear evidence of symptoms meeting criteria for depression. Remember to differentiate between temporary stress and clinical depression, and stress the importance of a professional evaluation for mental health concerns.
