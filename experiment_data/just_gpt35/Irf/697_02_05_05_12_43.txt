True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Had an extremely depressive episode when I was 15 it lasted for 3 years and it was allleviated after that but not I am not only having depression but just sessions of excitement followed by depression again. My brain is fucked I have no chance my family is fucked my life is fucked I have had poor health since childhood and still do. Sometimes I just feel I am losing my mind, too poor for medical help or anykind of help talking with others doesnt work. The threshold of my ambitions was just getting lower and lower through out the year first I wanted to be a doctor (no way) now I am even contemplating if I should go to college as opposed to just root and die. I really can't see any pro in this life I am tired of crying and wheeping and whining over and over i am tired of my family my health everything about me i wish i wasnt born. I dont want to talk i am tired and exhausted all the time again i wish i died when i was a child my life is gone i spent my teenage years depression and was so close to do it multipile times and now i am now in my 20s what is left nothing absolutely nothing i want to sleep for ever

The post indicates feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and a desire to die. The individual expresses a belief that they are a burden to their family and society. These thoughts and emotions suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a common feature of depressive disorders and can increase the risk of suicidal ideation.
