Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  No one loves me, I have no friends, I'm spending new years alone in my bed. I refuse to take my anti depressants because I'm scared they will make me happy and I don't deserve happiness because i'm an awful person and everyone leaves me.

Yes
The post shows a strong sense of loneliness, feeling unloved and abandoned by others, and a belief that the people in their life would be better off without them. These feelings indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a key factor in the development of certain mental health problems, such as depression and suicidal ideation.
