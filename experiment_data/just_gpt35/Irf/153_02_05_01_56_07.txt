  Okay, here it goes. I don‚Äôt really care if this isn‚Äôt a throwaway account, it‚Äôs whatever. During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn‚Äôt care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good. When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i‚Äôve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it‚Äôs only gotten worse. I now spend all time i can get in my room, under a blanket, won‚Äôt call anyone because i don‚Äôt want anyone to hear how bad i sound, don‚Äôt let anyone see me because of how bad i look, etc. I‚Äôve attempted suicide once, and that one time my dad walked in on me trying to hang myself. I‚Äôve given it lots of thought since then, and honestly, every day it feels like a better option. I don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm posting this, something in me told me to post this here. Hope everyone reading this has a fantastic day, though.
