Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Where you feel really shitty but you still think positively of yourself in your head (im a kind person, a generous person, a clean person, etc) so that gives you some self esteem and you start to feel more confident, and them people (esp ones close to you) tell you the exact opposite? Like  youre selfish  or  that thing you do is weird/gross  or something like that? Its always been really hard for me to describe this experience but its the one thing that makes me cry almost every time, depending on how close the person is to me. and it happened again recently. its horrible how it feels. basically not even having confidence in your own traits and then being told you're the thing you DONT want to be and thought you were 100% not... like you FINALLY have a shred of happiness about youself but then youre told you dont even have that DOES THIS MAKE SENSE? It keeps happening and makes me feel worthless.

The post suggests that the individual experiences a persistent cycle of feeling down on themselves, thinking positively of themselves to boost self-esteem, and then being told the opposite by close people. This pattern indicates a risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may believe that they are a burden to others and that their positive self-perceptions are invalidated by others' negative opinions. This can lead to feelings of worthlessness and emotional distress.
