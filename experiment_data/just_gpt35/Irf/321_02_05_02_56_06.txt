Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I feel so empty. I don‚Äôt even know what to write here because I just.. I am.. I don‚Äôt want to be in this body, in this depressed brain anymore. It doesn‚Äôt feel fair. All I‚Äôve ever done is help people. I worked in nursing homes for years. Now I work with developmentally disabled adults. I feel like I‚Äôve been grasping at a reason to live. If I‚Äôm consistently helping someone else live a happier/healthier/easier life, maybe I‚Äôll get better. Maybe I‚Äôll deserve to get better. I have only gotten worse.
