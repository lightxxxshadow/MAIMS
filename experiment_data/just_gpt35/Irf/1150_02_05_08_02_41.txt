Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs an active forum somewhere online I can chat with others at. Talking to someone 1 on 1 on reddit has always bothered me, so I appreciate anyone who offers but I‚Äôm definitely looking more for a casual group setting so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the center of attention. I may feel like I want to die but I‚Äôm definitely not going to do it tonight, others could use the help.
