Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Anyone else hate talking about depression specifically because all the attempts at help feel fake? Guess it’s stupid posting this, all things considered, but I’m a moron anyway and besides that I’m also looking just to see if I’m alone in thinking this. Like at this point I’d rather just hear comments from people who are also feeling down. “Help” from others makes me fucking angry at them, especially strangers, because it doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t make me feel better to be told “things will get better!”, it doesn’t help to be told I’m loved, and in the event people bring up stuff like “you’ll never get to have a family” (yes this does happen as though that matters) it makes me want to actually hurt them in real life. I don’t and can’t, but holy shit. I don’t even like when friends try to make me feel better anymore because it feels like they don’t even get the point. What sucks though is trying to get over that primal instinct to not kill myself. I don’t particularly want to live and I really don’t want to live past ~40, but my dumb animal brain just thinks “owie death and pain bad” and won’t let me do it. I’m kinda hoping that maybe instead I can get into an accident or just get really ill.
