Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I am almost 30. My net worth is close to 0. I have no inheritance. I have no friends. On my last birthday I was wished by 2 people. I am successful at my job but I am deeply unsatisfied. My fiancee just broke our engagement and emigrated to a different country after we found out I have no inheritance. My remaining parent has been diagnosed with cancer. Why should I look forward to the new year?
