True Label:	No
Post:
  I don‚Äôt know why I am so fucked up but I never feel like I can trust my parents word. My siblings are completely self successful and on their straight path to be coming everything the world wants them to be but me? I‚Äôm stuck in reverse. Sitting at home too anxious or exhausted to even shower or brush my teeth. My parents tell me they love me and they don‚Äôt care how long it takes me to succeed but I don‚Äôt believe them. I want to... but a part of me will always never believe them.
