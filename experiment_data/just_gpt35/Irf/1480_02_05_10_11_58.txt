  I make fun of my friend for being skinny and punch her around. I jab at my other friend everytime she makes a little mistake. I'm an asshole. I just make fun of people out of instinct, and complain when people do the same to me. I'm a toxic ass hypocrite. yet I complain, sit on my ass, and don't change. ironic.
