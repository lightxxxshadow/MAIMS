Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Stuck entering the new year wondering if my friends still like me like the pathetic piece of trash that i am. I dont know what I'm even doing. I'm always wondering if people still like me because I know I suck, and I'm scared they know too. Thought 2018 would start out great, I found someone I truely love, My friend and I had plans to make a short film, and I thought all was going great...but here I am...Listening to Def Leppard and hating myself. Cheers. Edit: Adding more because i feel even shittier. I had a conversation with someone and of course me being the fuck up i am said some awkward shit and now im sitting here pondering if they hate me even more. Fun. Lovin' life.

The post indicates a strong fear of being disliked and a constant need to be reassured of one's worthiness as a friend. The mention of feeling like a 'pathetic piece of trash' and 'hating oneself' suggests a low self-esteem. The poster also mentions making awkward comments and fears that others may hate them even more, which highlights a concern with social acceptance and potential rejection. These factors indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness.
