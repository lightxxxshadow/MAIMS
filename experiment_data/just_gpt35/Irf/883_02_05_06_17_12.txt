Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  So, I'm new to Reddit and mostly for the sole purpose of being a bit social and talk about my depression and anxiety issues.. Though I aspire to be an artist, that's what my username is all about, and express myself that way because I haven't been able to express myself in a very long time.. Today is my easy-going day.. so I smoked some ganja, eating some chocolate and trying to get myself out there, even if that is online and far away from living, breathing human beings! :3 (my boyfriend does the shopping, I just hide from the world). &amp;#x200B; Anyhow, not sure what else to say.. I mean.. it says 'behave like you would in real life' so I guess I'm going to go back to hiding now :3
