Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post shows a risk of perceived burdensomeness based on the following factors: the poster feels like a burden on society, thinks their death would be a relief to others, believes the people in their life wish they could be rid of them, and feels like they make things worse for others. These thoughts and feelings indicate a high level of self-perceived burden and may be indicative of a mental health problem related to perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Avoid inferring negative characteristics or feelings that are not explicitly stated. The poster does not mention feeling like a burden on society or thinking their death would be a relief to others; these are assumptions made without evidence. Focus on the information provided without adding interpretations not supported by the data. In the answered questions, the respondent suggests that they don't perceive themselves as a burden (Questions 2 to 4) but feel disconnected from others (Questions 11 to 14), which is a different issue. To improve, carefully analyze the given information and avoid drawing unwarranted conclusions.

ITER 1
No
The post does not show explicit evidence of perceived burdensomeness. The poster mentioned feeling miserable and being in a bad situation but does not directly state that they think they are a burden to others or that their death would be a relief.

Incorrect
Review the answered questions which indicate feelings of being a burden and disconnect from others. Relate these back to the concept of perceived burdensomeness and provide a more nuanced interpretation of the post in the context of these responses.

ITER 2
Yes
The post shows a risk of perceived burdensomeness as indicated by the answers to the questions: 'These days, I think the people in my life wish they could be rid of me' and 'These days, I think I make things worse for the people in my life.' These responses suggest a sense of feeling like a burden and being disconnected from others.

Correct
Ensure that your conclusions are directly supported by the information provided. Watch out for any over-inference or assumptions that are not warranted by the available data. Continue to draw connections between the expressed feelings of the poster and the corresponding answers to the mental health scale. Remember to cautiously interpret the data to avoid diagnosing without sufficient evidence, and always refer back to the source material to justify your conclusions.
