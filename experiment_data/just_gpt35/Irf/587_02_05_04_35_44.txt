Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Been fighting this for several years. Right now I just feel dead on the inside. My closest friend is struggling herself, after recent events in her life. I can't even help her. I know she likes having me around but I can't shake the thought that everyone would be better off without me. I feel so close to giving up. I have supportive parents which I'm grateful for, and a few friends but I'm feeling an extremely strong urge to isolate myself completely. They would all get on fine without me around making them sad. Honestly, I would go and end it all if it wasn't for my parents because that would destroy them. But I'm tired of living. I don't know what to do.
