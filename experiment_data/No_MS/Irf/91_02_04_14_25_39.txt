Yes
The post expresses feelings of worthlessness, pain, and a desire for happiness. This indicates a possible risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the person feels unable to find happiness and may perceive themselves as a burden on others.

Correct
Ensure when assessing posts for perceived burdensomeness to look for explicit statements of feeling like a burden to others and not infer this from general expressions of distress unless clearly stated.
