Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly? Hello, I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table. We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me   I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week .  I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves. This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested. She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family. I really do not know what to think... My friends say fuck her move on. I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good. I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out. Thank you for your time and help. Cheers, Your Reddit friend.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
Based on the information provided, the poster describes symptoms consistent with depression, such as feeling sad much of the time, feeling lost in their personal life, not enjoying things as much as before, self-dislike, self-critical or blaming thoughts, difficulty in concentration, and feeling too tired or fatigued to do most things they used to do. These symptoms indicate a possible presence of depression.

Incorrect
The answer does not accurately reflect the information provided. The symptoms described come from the girlfriend being spoken about in the post, not the poster themselves. When assessing for depression, ensure that you are analyzing the correct individual's symptoms. Revisit the post and answers to the mental health scale questions, and identify whose mental health is being assessed. Your response should reflect the mental state of the person in question, not someone else mentioned in the scenario.

ITER 1
Yes
Based on the information provided, the poster's girlfriend is showing symptoms of depression, such as feeling lost in her personal life, experiencing a lack of pleasure, self-disliking, self-accusations, and difficulty with concentration and decision-making. Therefore, it is likely that the poster's girlfriend is suffering from depression.

Incorrect
Ensure you are analyzing the correct individual's mental health. The question asks about the poster, but you have assessed the poster's girlfriend. Refocus your analysis on the person the question is about and avoid making inferences about individuals not being directly assessed.

ITER 2
Yes
Based on the poster's description, they exhibit symptoms of depression such as feeling lost in their personal life, experiencing a prolonged period of sadness, loss of interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, feeling tired or fatigued, and expressing a strong emotional attachment and longing for the relationship with their girlfriend. These symptoms align with the criteria for depression and suggest that the poster may be experiencing depressive symptoms.

Incorrect
Remember that the objective of the task is to analyze the mental health condition of the poster based on the information provided. The symptoms listed are expressed by the poster's girlfriend, not the poster himself. You need to focus on the feelings and behaviors of the individual being directly assessed. For future tasks, carefully distinguish between the poster's experience and that of the people they describe. Refrain from making inferences beyond the information presented in the post and the answered questions directed at the subject of the mental health scale.

ITER 3
Yes
Based on the information provided, the poster's girlfriend exhibits several symptoms of depression, such as feeling lost, decreased enjoyment in activities, self-dislike, self-criticism, difficulty making decisions, decreased interest in others, difficulty concentrating, and increased tiredness or fatigue.

Incorrect
Carefully differentiate between the subject of the mental health assessment and the person providing the information. In this case, the mental health assessment should focus on the girlfriend, not the poster. Avoid making assumptions about the poster's mental health based on observations made about another individual. For future tasks, ensure you are analyzing the mental health of the correct individual and separate observations about others from self-reported symptoms unless directly relevant to the person being assessed.

ITER 4
Yes
The poster's girlfriend exhibits several symptoms of depression, including feeling lost in her personal life, not finding happiness, lack of interest in activities, difficulty in making decisions, difficulty concentrating, feeling tired or fatigued, and changes in sleeping patterns.

Incorrect
The poster is describing observations about their girlfriend's behaviors, not their own mental health. When analyzing for depression using a mental health scale, the patient's self-reported information should be used, not second-hand descriptions. Review the subject's direct responses and assess whether they meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis. Additionally, avoid overgeneralizing from the behavior of others around the individual in question. Focus solely on the direct answers and information provided by the individual being assessed.

ITER 5
Yes
Based on the responses to the depression scale, the poster expresses feelings of sadness, being lost in their personal life, not enjoying things as much as they used to, self-dislike, being more self-critical, finding it difficult to make decisions, decreased interest in other people or things, decreased concentration, feeling tired or fatigued, and difficulty finding happiness. These responses indicate a high likelihood of depression.

Incorrect
Ensure that you are evaluating the mental health of the correct individual. The social media post describes the poster's experiences and actions regarding someone else, not themselves. The answered questions from a relevant mental health scale appear to reflect the experiences of the girlfriend, not the poster. It is important to differentiate between the two individuals and assess the responses in relation to the person they are meant to describe. To avoid this mistake in the future, carefully identify the subject of the post and the subject of the mental health scale responses, ensuring they match before making a diagnosis.

ITER 6
Yes
The poster's girlfriend exhibits symptoms consistent with depression, such as sadness, feeling lost, lack of enjoyment, self-dislike, self-critical thoughts, difficulty making decisions, concentration difficulties, fatigue, and decreased interest in others and activities.

Incorrect
Remember to focus on the person specified in the mental health question. The question asks about the poster, not their girlfriend. Assess the poster’s own words and responses to the mental health scale to determine their mental health, rather than inferring it from their descriptions of someone else.
