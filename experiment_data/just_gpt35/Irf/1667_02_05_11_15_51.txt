Post:
  i'm a foreveralone with suicidal depression. i need to be held, by fucking anyone at this point. i don't have the money for a prostitute otherwise thats what i'd do. i posted a craigslist ad but im a random 32 year old man and no one's gonna be sympathetic probably. i need to be touched. i don't know what to do. i cannot leave the house, i cannot and do not care anymore to develop social skills to find a woman, nor would any woman want to date an unemployed balding 5'6  suicidal depression sufferer on disability. i am at a breaking point to be completely honest. what do i do. i want to be held and stroked and comforted physically. i swear to god i am not looking for sex. i don't have my dog with me anymore. my family won't let me live with them.
