Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  On paper things should seem fine, the few people I've told I want to kill myself on a constant basis brush it off as me being hyperbolic or something. I think about suicide every day and I have for a very long time. Every day is just a physical underlying pain, that I can't really pinpoint. I just want it to stop. The depression or whatever, doesn't ever go away, no matter if I change my work, have money or dont, with or without romantic partners, or how my social life is doing. I can't seem to dig out any actual real trauma. I just want to die, and I think about it all of the time, but I'm just too much of a coward to go through with it, so far. I just want help to end this.
