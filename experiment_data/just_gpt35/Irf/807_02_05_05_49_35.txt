Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me. I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time... Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply  break up  with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier. Sorry this post is sort of messy and all over the place, I just needed to vent... It's hard, very hard. Happy new year to you all, let's hope 2017 will be better
