Do Mental Health Analysis:

Yes
The post indicates a strong feeling of being a burden to others, as reflected in the answers to questions 3, 5, and 6 of the mental scale. The poster believes that they make things worse for the people in their life, that the people wish to be rid of them, and that they are a burden on society. These thoughts suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the individual perceives themselves as a burden and believes others would be better off without them.

Correct
Continue to utilize the responses from the mental health scale to accurately assess the poster's feelings of perceived burdensomeness. Ensure to differentiate between the poster's perspective and that of others, and avoid making additional inferences that are not supported by the provided information.
