True Label:	No
Post:
  My mom caught me with someone, I lied and now she is mad... tl;dr: Mom caught me with someone and also caught me in a big lie. My mom (F54) caught me in a huge lie as well after that, because I was trying to get her out of the house, things have been complicated since I've been lying. Today she arrived sooner than expected and well what i was trying to avoid happened. She is telling me I'm like a 14 year old and doesn't understand why i've done this. That I don't do shit despite me doing house stuff, and working. That  I was your age too  conversation happened. I'm 22 years old and I'm thinking about moving out and doing my own thing, but I feel like I don't need to update people every 10 minutes, is that just me? I don't think I have been lying to her, I just didn't told her I was seeing someone, and to be honest what was she expecting me to say?? To be honest I don't know what to do, can you guys help me dealing with this?? I kinda feel worthless at this point too because of all the things she said to me

No
The poster's situation seems to be related to a conflict with their mother and feelings of worthlessness due to the things she said. Although the poster may be experiencing distress and uncertainty, there is not enough evidence in their post to suggest that they are suffering from depression.

Correct
Continue to assess posts without jumping to conclusions that are not supported by the evidence provided. Be cautious of over-pathologizing normal life stressors and ensure that diagnostic criteria are being accurately referenced before making any claims about mental health conditions.
