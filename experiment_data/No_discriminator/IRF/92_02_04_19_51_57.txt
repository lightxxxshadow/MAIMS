Yes
The response to the mental scale questions indicates that the individual experiences feelings of being disconnected from others, feeling like an outsider in social gatherings, and having limited interactions with caring and supportive friends. These feelings suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological term used to describe a perceived lack of social connection and belongingness.
