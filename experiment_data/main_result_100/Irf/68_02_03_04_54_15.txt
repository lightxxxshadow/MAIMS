Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm using a new account because I can't remember my old password for my main account. But yeah I'm probably dead tonight. Im 20 and moved from the East coast to St Louis about 5 months ago ( it feels longer ). I got a good job delivering but quit it almost two weeks ago because I'm a bitch and was having an anxiety attack. I don't know what's wrong with me. A bit before quitting I went into the er because I was suicidal and spent 4 days trapped and with no actual help. I faked being better to get out. My only friends were at this job and they're mad at me ( understandably ). My old roommates are holding some of my stuff hostage until I pay them a certain amount of money. I've been couch surfing for the entire time up here. This was stupid. I hate myself. Sorry if it's not making too much sense I can't think straight right now. It doesn't matter either way.

Yes
The post indicates a sense of isolation, disconnection, and burden on society. The individual expresses feelings of being better off dead, being a burden on others, and making things worse for the people in their life. They also report feeling disconnected, like an outsider, and lacking supportive friends. These are all signs of thwarted belongingness.

Correct
Continue to evaluate the expressed feelings and beliefs of the individual when determining the risk of thwarted belongingness. Ensure to differentiate between the poster's personal mental health and that of the people around them, and avoid inferring characteristics that are not supported by the provided information.
