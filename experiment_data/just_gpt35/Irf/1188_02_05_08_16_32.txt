Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  If you‚Äôre constantly doubting yourself and spectating peers you don‚Äôt even care about, consider deleting your social media outlets. I‚Äôve done it recently, and although it feels like I lost a limb, I‚Äôm already focusing on my self because I only HAVE access to myself and not what others are doing. My dreams and aspirations are becoming more clear and I‚Äôm able to see what I want to do. I‚Äôm looking to get into some acting classes soon, this is something I was once embarrassed to look into because I focused on what my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that I graduated high school with would say. When in actuality that doesn‚Äôt matter, nothing does. Whatever YOU want to do, go hard now.
