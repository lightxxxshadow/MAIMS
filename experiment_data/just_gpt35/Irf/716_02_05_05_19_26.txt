Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've never opened up to anyone, in person or anyone I know in person. I've only ever been honest when talking anonymously with strangers on the internet. Basically this lame nearly-20 year old has wanted to die for five years and I'm now at the point where it's get help or just do it already. so I changed doctors, the switch finally went through today, but I can't bring myself to schedule an appointment. I've lied to my family, friends (the one I still have lmao), and doctors for years. How can I be honest now? does anyone else struggle with this? being unable to open up? I've emotionally isolated myself due to fear of vulnerability and self hatred and I don't know if I could ever open up during therapy, let alone at a doctors appointment about requesting therapy. I get shakey and anxious and want to puke just thinking about it. It's so bad that I won't even come out as a lesbian, even though my family is very liberal and have told me multiple times if I was it'd be fine. but being honest/emotional/myself just feels terrifying. Obviously - I've never been in a relationship either because of it. How do I get over this (at least a little bit) so I can get help and medication?? I can't do 6 years. I barely made 5.
