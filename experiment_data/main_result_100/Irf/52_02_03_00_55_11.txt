True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Can‚Äôt make anyone happy anymore, what‚Äôs the point? None of my friends care despite me reaching out and my fianc√©e is fed up with my depressive shit. Don‚Äôt even think he wants to marry me any more. I can tell he resents me. I can‚Äôt fix the things that are wrong with me. Why bother with anything? Don‚Äôt wanna upset my family so I‚Äôll just keep trecking on I guess. Just needed to vent cause I don‚Äôt have any real people to talk to.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

Yes
The post indicates feelings of isolation, not having anyone to talk to, and believing that no one cares or wants them around. These feelings suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is characterized by perceiving oneself as disconnected from and burdensome to others.

Correct
Excellent analysis recognizing the indicators of thwarted belongingness. Remember to consistently cross-reference the subject's expressed feelings with the responses from the mental health scale and maintain objectivity without over-inferencing.
