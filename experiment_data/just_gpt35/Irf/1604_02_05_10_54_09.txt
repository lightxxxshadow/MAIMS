Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  failed my exams last year, retaking the year. got mocks coming up that are really important, and if i dont do well i can get kicked off again. dont have the strength to keep going after being held back twice. on top of that i was a dick to my girlfriend and now she full on hates me, obviously deserved (not trying to blame her) but it's still shit. have no friends, nobody to talk to, and dont know how to get it out. been close to calling a hotline but can never quite bring myself, never feel deserving of one
