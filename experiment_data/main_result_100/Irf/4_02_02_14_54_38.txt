Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have found that one of the main issues keeping me from being productive and moving forward is my inability to believe in myself. That is, I‚Äôm too worried about what others perceive me to be, and never being able to relax and exist in the moment. I‚Äôve had therapy and medication for depression but none of it helps. If I can‚Äôt be better or get better, what‚Äôs the point? Why shouldn‚Äôt I just kill myself? I don‚Äôt want to keep trying. Life is boring. All my wildest dreams always lead to me ending up alone in some way or another. All so I can die without hurting anyone. I‚Äôve been going over the attempts at suicide I‚Äôve made in the past, and wonder if I just can‚Äôt follow through on anything. All the self harm and pushing people away are just half measures to the real solution. I‚Äôm lost and alone, 5 dollars to whoever wants a free pass to kill me.

Yes
The post indicates a strong sense of disconnection, loneliness, and feeling like an outsider in social situations. The poster expresses a belief that they are a burden on society and that others would be better off without them. These feelings of isolation and perceived lack of belonging suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is associated with an increased risk of suicide.

Correct
Continue to integrate evidence from posts and scale responses. Beware of over-interpreting or making assumptions beyond the explicit content. Keep differentiating between the poster's own thoughts and the potential perspective of others in their life.
