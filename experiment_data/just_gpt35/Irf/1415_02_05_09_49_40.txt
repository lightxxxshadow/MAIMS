Post:
  I'm just some dumb fucking tranny so my death wouldn't mean shit but another statistic. I relapsed for the first time fucking forever. My meds are fucked I'm a month out from seeing my doctor to get them fixed I see my therapist soon but he can't prescribe shit. My mom tells me she loves me but I can't talk to her cause I'll dissapoint her. It'd break her heart to say  I want to fucking die and splice my arms open . I'm not going to cause more issues for anyone else. I can't start hormones even with my moms support because we have to do it so secretly and if I wait until I'm legally an adult waiting that long for hormones I don't want to be seen as some tranny fag dude I want to pass I never want to have to hear me be referred to female again I want to live as my authentic self it's horrible not being able to live as who I fucking am and have to live as a subset I just want to be normal I wish my brain was normal I wish I had friends I don't even have anyone to fucking talk to except to nobody on a forum I'm just so Fucking pathetic. Fuck
