Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  If you're fuvked up in the head at this point which I'm assuming you are enough, such that even if you want to, your body does not do as you want it to. You want to run but it doesn't move, you want to scream and shout for help but are to afraid to, you try not to look like your eyes are gonna pop out from your skull any minute and you try to control your fast breathing and trembling voice when you're trying to seem unaffected by the things that remind you of your trauma But it doesn't obey you. Your body is as though it doesn't care that they look exposed and scared and weak in the eyes of those who want to harm it. And these people enjoy it, the pain your in and inflict more onto you for their own amusement. It's sickening, this world we live in with these monsters called humans. Donkeys are used as a degrading term but they are far better then us in regards to empathy, love and care. We probably are an insult to them and this world as a whole.
