Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  It's like a deep feeling that I'm just gonna ruin everything all over again. and that everyone will just leave me behind because of me. It's only 11:14AM since I tried sleeping in to skip the day, and then sleep for longer at nighttime. It's like a collection of suicidal thoughts and anxieties only over one year. I felt as if I was unable to make a New Years resolution because of it. I'm too hopeless to even make one. I feel like a mess. I want to die. My depression just wont go away, no matter what I do each year, it's just there.
