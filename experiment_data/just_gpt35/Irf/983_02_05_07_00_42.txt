Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I just want to end it. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about for the past few days. I have no friends and no one will ever truly care about me. I haven‚Äôt been able to stop crying and the pain has just become unbearable. I just want it to go away. My parents and boyfriend push me to keep going and to try everyday to be happy but I just can‚Äôt fucking do it anymore. They don‚Äôt understand how hard it is. I just want it to go away. I don‚Äôt want to study and have a good job, I don‚Äôt want to live. No life will ever make up for the pain I feel. I don‚Äôt actually have the courage to go and that makes me even more pathetic.
