Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks. It's like everything else in my life is so insignificant in comparison, it's like a black hole that distorts my perception of time. It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago. People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are. People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up. I feel like I've just always been a little gloomy and don't feel very different now compared to before other than the whole bending of time thing. People say they noticed a change in me, but I didn't, maybe they just expect something like that to mess up a 14 year old?

####################################
Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's feelings of disconnection from others, feeling that people in their life would be happier without them, and lack of satisfying interactions indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness.

Incorrect
Evaluate the evidence from the social media post and the responses to the mental health scale questions carefully, without overgeneralization or assumptions. Focus on the poster's expressed feelings rather than inferring unstated emotions, and differentiate between the poster's perspective and the observations of others about the poster.

ITER 1
Yes
The post suggests a feeling of disconnection from others and a lack of satisfying interactions. Additionally, the poster expresses that people might be happier without them and that they make things worse for others. These feelings align with the concept of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for mental health problems.

Incorrect
Review the evidence carefully before drawing conclusions. The poster does not state that people would be happier without them or that they make things worse for others; those statements were denied in the answers to the questions on the mental health scale. The response should reflect what the poster has actually expressed, which includes some feelings of disconnection, not assumptions beyond the provided information. Focus on the poster's direct expressions and answered questions to assess their feelings of belongingness accurately.

ITER 2
Yes
The post expresses feelings of disconnection and a lack of satisfying interactions with others. The poster also indicates that they don't feel they have anyone to turn to in times of need. These are signs of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for certain mental health issues.

Correct
Continue to analyze posts and scale questions carefully to avoid over-inferencing and misattributing the experiences of others to the poster. Ensure to differentiate between the poster's feelings and the opinions of those around them.
