Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I don't trust my in-laws with my daughter. I just don't. It's hard to explain. Maybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I'm old-fashioned. Bottom line is: Their lifestyles, comments to me, comments about my kids, bad tempers, alcohol intake, drug use, and pasts instill in me no confidence that they can be responsible caretakers of my daughter. I hear so many stories of child abuse -- sexual abuse, especially. From family members, most often. I'm just not comfortable taking that risk. I'm not afraid to offend my in-laws. But other family members say I'm being unreasonable. What's a healthy perspective here? Does every parent have these fears? Am I being unreasonable? Should I trust my instincts?
