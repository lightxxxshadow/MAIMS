Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Something my dad said has been bothering me So a while back I decided to make some french onion soup for the first time. I don't cook very often and I'm not that good at it, so when I made the soup it seemed to turn out pretty good. I was kinda proud of my attempt and wanted my dad to try it to see what he thought of it. I brought him a small bowl to try it, and I know he was joking but it really hurt my feelings. He says to me as I hand the bowl to him,  It's not poison is it?  What do you guys think? Do you think it was just harmless joking? Or do you think he thinks I would actually do something horrible like that?

The post does not provide enough information to conclude that the poster is suffering from depression. The issue mentioned seems to be related more to feelings of hurt and insecurity rather than symptoms of depression.
