  I really miss playing ps1 games with my best friend all day, I miss not having to worry about anything. Is there any way of making this feeling stop ? (yes, I tried playing the same games I used to play but it just doesn't feels the same.)

The post indicates a longing for past experiences and a desire for connection with a friend.

This longing for the past and desire for connection may indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness.
