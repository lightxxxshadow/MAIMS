Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm using a new account because I can't remember my old password for my main account. But yeah I'm probably dead tonight. Im 20 and moved from the East coast to St Louis about 5 months ago ( it feels longer ). I got a good job delivering but quit it almost two weeks ago because I'm a bitch and was having an anxiety attack. I don't know what's wrong with me. A bit before quitting I went into the er because I was suicidal and spent 4 days trapped and with no actual help. I faked being better to get out. My only friends were at this job and they're mad at me ( understandably ). My old roommates are holding some of my stuff hostage until I pay them a certain amount of money. I've been couch surfing for the entire time up here. This was stupid. I hate myself. Sorry if it's not making too much sense I can't think straight right now. It doesn't matter either way.

Yes
The post includes statements indicating feelings of worthlessness, self-hatred, and expressing a desire to end one's life. These factors indicate a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, where the poster may believe that they are a burden to others and feel that ending their life would relieve that burden.

Correct
Continue to closely scrutinize posts for direct and indirect indications of mental health concerns, such as expressions of self-hatred and burdensomeness. However, remain cautious not to make unwarranted assumptions beyond the information provided, and always differentiate between the poster's feelings and those of the people surrounding them.
