Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  It just blows my mind. Are there really people out there that wake up, don't continue to lay in bed, and just start doing things? I dunno how they do it. I don't get how someone could enjoy whatever their hobbies are, and enjoy them without ever stopping due to how pointless it is, or how pointless all of life is. I can't imagine what it's like to have a family that loves you, or to be an important person to anyone else. Some people can get so much out of life with minimal effort, and all I can really do is lay in bed and cry about how nothing makes me feel good, how I can't enjoy anything, and how incredibly lonely and alien I feel. Classic question: Why me?
