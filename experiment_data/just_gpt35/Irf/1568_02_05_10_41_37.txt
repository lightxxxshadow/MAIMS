Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable. Anybody else have any similar experiences? Should I stick with it or find someone else?

The post does not show risk of thwarted belongingness. There is no mention of feeling disconnected, isolated, or lacking social support. The poster's discomfort seems to stem from the unconventional location, the counselor's remarks, and the suggestion to explore metaphysics.
