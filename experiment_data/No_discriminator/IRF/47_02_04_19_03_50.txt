True Label:	No

Yes
Based on the poster's answers to the mental scale, they have indicated that they feel like a burden on society, that the people in their life wish they could be rid of them, and that they rarely interact with people who care about them. These responses suggest a risk of perceived burdensomeness, which is a characteristic often associated with depression and anxiety.
