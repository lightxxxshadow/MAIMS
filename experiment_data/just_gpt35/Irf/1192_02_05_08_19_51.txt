Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I'm mid 21 and balding and to add to it I'm 5'6. I've already accepted I won't have a love life but I can't come to terms what how I'll be treated by society, people I know. If not suicidal then I've thought that I wouldn't mind dying. Also I don't need anyone to talk about dying kids in Africa. To add to this I've got my exams which I should be ok for. The other thing is that after exams I'll probably go to a psychiatrist. Before I went to a counsellor which helped a bit but I'd hardly say they cured me.

The poster expresses feelings of not having a love life and being treated poorly by society and people they know. They also mention thoughts of dying and not needing to hear about other people's struggles. These feelings suggest a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a psychological state characterized by feelings of disconnection, rejection, and social isolation.
