Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I've been in one of those disassociation periods for months now. I just checked the group chat that I now leave muted and I couldn't think of many things worse than a night out of regulated happiness, with the countdown, that awful song and people who actually want to go into 2018, with their aspirations and shit. Well, one thing worse would be staying home to watch millions of pounds/euros/dollars/whatever being absolutely spunked away on fireworks, right overhead of the poverty/homelessness stricken major cities of the world. How anyone enjoys those things is beyond me. You've gotta feel bad for the animals too, domesticated and wild... Anyway, best wishes and all that jazz, my dudes. Edit: Just pretend I said  the one time of the year to feel more out of place than Xmas  and forgive my 4am brain for the shit post title
