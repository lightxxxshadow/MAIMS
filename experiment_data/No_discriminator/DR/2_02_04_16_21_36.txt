Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  What do you do after a full days work? What are your hobbies, habits, and routines? What keeps you busy? When I am not busy and productive is when I get the most depressed. Keeping my mind occupied is critical, but I also suck with routine in my life. The only things I routinely do are go to my day job, work out afterwards, and eat dinner. Other than that it is all up in the air. Just want to see how everyone else spends their time after an 8+ hour day.
