Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes

  That's it. This isn't a new year's resolution because that shit is nonsense people tell themselves to feel better. I'm GOING to beat this shit. The last month I can confidently say has been THE WORST month of my life and I have been through A LOT OF SHIT during the last 27 years of my existence. At least during those times, I wasn't depressed (somehow). I know what I need to do. I need to find a therapist who understands what I'm going through. I must have been chipping away at a mental wall I built up or something all this time because it finally came crashing down after a series of thoughts and I NEED to tell someone about it. Someone I can trust. The fact that the simple thought of it gives me hope and makes me feel better means I know I'm right. I don't think it's a chemical issue in my case. It's a cyclical one, only eased when I drink several cans of beer before inevitably passing out since otherwise I WILL be up all night - no question. For the first time in my life I am  looking more forward to  (phrase used loosely since there aren't many things I can truly enjoy lately) work and this annoying festive vacation to end because I won't be alone with my thoughts. I WILL beat this. I HAVE to. And to anyone reading this post who feels the same way you CAN too. Sometimes, there are some things in life we just can't beat alone.

The post indicates a sense of isolation and the need for finding someone to talk to. The poster mentions feeling alone with their thoughts and expresses a desire to share their experiences with someone they can trust. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, which is characterized by feelings of social isolation and not having social connections or support.
