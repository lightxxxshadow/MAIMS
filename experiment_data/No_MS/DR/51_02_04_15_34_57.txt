Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  The good times don't make the bad times worth living. People always act like it's worth living through bad times so you can experience the good times but to me it doesn't feel worth it. Even the good times are tainted and I can barely ever even  enjoy  them the way I'm supposed to. They barely even make it into the picture when I think about my life.
