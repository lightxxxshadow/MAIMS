Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I've been getting progressively worse throughout this year, and I found myself having the exact same days over and over again. My social life is pretty much nonexistent at this point, and I've found myself struggling to hold onto friends that are drifting away from me. Then I started playing this game, and I'm actually excited to get back to my apartment and spend time in this world. It feels so rewarding even just to spend the whole day hunting or working on a level 10 beard. It gives me a sense of purpose I haven't really been feeling lately. I'm probably going to spend about a month in each chapter of the game because I want to prolong my time playing. Just wanted to share my experiences as this game has definitely made my life more positive in the last month.
