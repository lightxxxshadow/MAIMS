Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  I have children so I keep going. As they get older I realise how lonely I am. Been single for 5 years, pretend I'm all groovy 'I don't need a man'. Boys are getting older now and rather than wanting to play board games and go into the woods for hide and seek etc they just play on the Xbox. And I'm pottering around the house wanting some company, real company. Someone to say 'want a cuppa?' Or to have a random conversation with. I'm scared once my boys are content and moved out I'll be more lonely, no purpose and I'll go so far down that people won't notice as I hide it. I work for a charity and visit lonely old people. I don't want to be one of them. I'm only 29 and shouldn't feel like this all because I'm single, surly? It's really getting to me if I mention it to friends I just get 'awww you will meet someone, carry on being a strong independent woman until then' Ok then. That's me sorted üòí
