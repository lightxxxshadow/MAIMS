Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  21. I have several autoimmune disorders (lupus is the main) and have a hard time keeping on weight. I‚Äôm in a lot of pain. I‚Äôm also lonely because I don‚Äôt have any friends except for my fianc√©, but family isn‚Äôt around. I work full time as a valet and go to school full time. Tonight I got hypothermia and frostbite on my left foot at work because I don‚Äôt want to admit I have inabilities in the cold because of the lupus (I have neuropathy and vascular issues). I‚Äôm in so much pain tonight and don‚Äôt know what to do. I hate being in so much pain. I just don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this and don‚Äôt want to introduce it to anyone. It hurts me as well as others.

The post indicates that the poster feels lonely, lacks friends, and doesn't have anyone to talk to about their pain and struggles. This sense of isolation and lack of social support is a clear indication of thwarted belongingness.
