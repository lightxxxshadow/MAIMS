Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  Let me start by saying I'm not an addict, but it was my first time trying opiates. Everything was going fine until I started sweating buckets, getting an intense itch, throwing up, and falling in and out of consciousness. I was incredibly fucking stupid and irresponsible. But coming that close to death has shaken me to my core and I don't know how to handle it. I could've lost everything because of one night.
